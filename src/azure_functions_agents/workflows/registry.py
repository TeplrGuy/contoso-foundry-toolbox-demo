"""Workflow-safe tool registry (M1 step 3c).

Neutral home for the registry of tools the workflow orchestrator can
dispatch via its activity. Sits between :mod:`.engine` (which looks up
handlers at activity-execution time) and :mod:`.integration` (which
turns discovered workflow tools into the effective tool set + addendum) so neither
has to import the other.

Three concepts kept distinct:

- **Registered**: known to the engine, dispatchable. Name → handler +
  description + ``public`` flag.
- **Public**: included in the effective workflow tool set unless filtered.
  Internal helpers like ``__echo`` are registered with ``public=False`` so
  they don't leak into agent-visible plans by accident.
- **Effective allowlist**: retained only as a compatibility fallback for direct
  helper callers. Production app construction passes an explicit agent policy.

Reserved names (the LLM-facing workflow-management tools themselves)
can never be registered — workflow nodes must never reach back into
the workflow control plane.
