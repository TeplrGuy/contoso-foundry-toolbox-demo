"""System-prompt addendum + integration entry point for the workflows feature.

Behavioral guidance for the workflow tools is owned by the runtime, not
by the agent markdown (see ``docs/workflows.md`` / "DX split"). When an
agent enables workflows in its frontmatter, the framework appends a
channel-specific addendum to the agent's system prompt. Chat endpoints
describe polling and synthetic completion notifications; declared triggers
describe short-lived starter behavior and terminal result sinks. Both cover
when to reach for a workflow and which tools the workflow can call.

The app factory builds one complete handler catalog and one immutable
workflow-agent-policy catalog, registers the Durable engine once, then builds each
workflow-enabled agent's tools and addenda without mutating the app.
``build_workflow_integration``
retains the original direct-helper behavior for compatibility tests and callers.
