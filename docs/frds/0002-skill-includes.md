# FRD 0002 — Skill file includes

## 1. Summary

Add markdown link include support to SKILL.md files: a standalone line containing
a markdown link with a relative path (e.g., `[api.md](./references/api.md)`)
will inline the referenced file's content during discovery. This enables skills
to reference external assets and documentation without manually copying content,
keeping SKILL.md files maintainable while allowing rich, modular instruction sets.

## 2. Motivation / problem

Today, a skill's instructions must be entirely self-contained within the
SKILL.md file. For skills with extensive reference material (API specs, code
examples, diagrams descriptions), this leads to either:

1. **Bloated SKILL.md files** — thousands of lines mixing core instructions with
   reference material, making maintenance difficult.
2. **Incomplete skills** — authors omit useful reference material to keep files
   manageable, reducing skill effectiveness.

Authors want to organize skills with supporting files:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Core instructions
├── assets/               # Images, diagrams, data files
│   └── workflow.png
└── references/           # Extended documentation
    ├── api-spec.md
    └── examples.md
```

MAF's `read_skill_resource` tool already allows agents to read files within the
skill directory at runtime. However, authors cannot pre-populate instructions
with reference content — they must either inline everything or rely on the agent
to discover and read resources dynamically.

Markdown link includes bridge this gap by resolving includes at discovery time,
so the skill's full instructions (including referenced content) are available
when the skill loads.

## 3. Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**
- Support `[text](./relative/path)` syntax in SKILL.md body content
- Resolve includes relative to the skill directory (not app root)
- Process includes recursively (included files can themselves include)
- Detect and fail on circular includes
- Preserve existing `${ENV_VAR}` substitution (includes processed first)
- Keep discovery read-only (no side effects beyond reading files)
- Use standard markdown syntax that renders correctly in GitHub/VS Code

**Non-goals**
- Front matter includes (only body content is processed)
- Glob patterns or wildcards
- Conditional includes or templating logic
- Binary file embedding (text files only)
- Cross-skill includes (`[x](./../../other-skill/file.md)` rejected)

## 4. Proposed design

| Pipeline stage | Module(s) | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| discover | `discovery/skills.py` | Add `_resolve_includes()` to process markdown link includes in skill content |
| discover | `discovery/skills.py` | Add `prepare_resolved_skills()` to write resolved skills to temp directory |
| translate | — | No change |
| register | `registration/capabilities.py` | Call `prepare_resolved_skills()` to get temp paths for skills with includes |
| execute | — | No change (MAF reads resolved content from temp paths) |

### Detailed design

**Challenge:** MAF's `SkillsProvider.from_paths()` reads `SKILL.md` files from
disk. We cannot inject resolved content in memory — MAF will re-read the
original file. The solution is to write resolved skills to a temp directory.

**Resolution flow:**

1. `discover_skills()` — unchanged, returns `dict[str, Path]` of skill
   directories (original paths).

2. `_resolve_includes(content, skill_dir)` — new helper that:
   - Regex matches markdown links on their own line with `./` prefix
   - Resolves each path relative to the skill directory
   - Rejects paths that escape the skill directory (security)
   - Reads referenced files as UTF-8 text
   - Recursively resolves nested includes (tracking visited paths for cycles)
   - Returns the fully resolved content

3. `prepare_resolved_skills(skills)` — new function that:
   - For each skill, checks if `SKILL.md` contains markdown link includes
   - If yes: creates a temp directory, copies the skill directory, writes
     resolved `SKILL.md`, returns the temp path
   - If no: returns the original path (no copy overhead)
   - Registers cleanup via `atexit` for the temp directory
   - Returns `dict[str, Path]` with temp paths where needed

4. Registration calls `prepare_resolved_skills()` before passing paths to MAF.

### Include syntax

```markdown
[descriptive text](./relative/path/to/file.md)
```

- Link must be on its own line (not inline with other text)
- Path must start with `./` to distinguish includes from regular links
- Path is relative to the skill directory (where SKILL.md lives)
- Whitespace around the link is allowed
- File extension is preserved (not assumed to be `.md`)
- Standard markdown syntax — renders as a link in GitHub/VS Code

### Error handling

| Condition | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| File not found | `ValueError` at startup (fail fast) |
| Path escapes skill directory | `ValueError` at startup |
| Circular include | `ValueError` at startup |
| Non-UTF-8 file | `ValueError` at startup |
| Empty path | `ValueError` at startup |

### Authoring / API surface

**New SKILL.md syntax (body only):**
```markdown
---
name: my-api-skill
description: Skill for interacting with the Foo API
---

# Foo API Skill

Use this skill when working with Foo API endpoints.

## API Reference

[api-spec.md](./references/api-spec.md)

## Examples

[examples.md](./references/examples.md)
```

**Supported directory structure:**
```
skills/
└── my-api-skill/
    ├── SKILL.md
    ├── assets/
    │   └── diagram.png       # Accessible via read_skill_resource
    └── references/
        ├── api-spec.md       # Can be included
        └── examples.md       # Can be included
```

### Compatibility

- **Backward compatible:** Skills without markdown link includes work unchanged.
- **No breaking changes:** Existing discovery API returns the same types, just
  with includes resolved in the content passed to MAF.

## 5. Decisions log

| # | Decision | Options considered | Choice | Decided by | Date |
| - | -------- | ------------------ | ------ | ---------- | ---- |
| 1 | Include syntax | `{{include:path}}`, `{!path!}`, `{% include %}`, `[text](./path)` | `[text](./path)` — standard markdown, renders in GitHub/VS Code | Human | 2026-06-29 |
| 2 | Processing stage | Discovery (eager), runtime (lazy via MAF) | Discovery (eager) | Agent | 2026-06-29 |
| 3 | Path resolution base | App root, skill directory | Skill directory | Agent | 2026-06-29 |
| 4 | Circular include handling | Warn and skip, error and fail | Error and fail | Agent | 2026-06-29 |
| 5 | MAF integration | In-memory injection, temp directory with resolved files | Temp directory — MAF's SkillsProvider reads from disk | Agent | 2026-06-29 |
| 6 | Temp directory cleanup | Manual, atexit, context manager | atexit — process-lifetime management | Agent | 2026-06-29 |
| 7 | Distinguish includes from links | All links, only standalone lines, `./` prefix required | Standalone lines with `./` prefix — clear intent, no accidental includes | Human | 2026-06-29 |
| 8 | **Feature scope** | Implement custom includes, use MAF-native `read_skill_resource` | **Use MAF-native** — avoids extra I/O, aligns with progressive disclosure pattern | Human | 2026-06-30 |

## 6. Test plan

N/A — feature not implemented.

## 7. Docs impact

- [x] `docs/architecture.md` — Updated skills.py description (removed include resolution)
- [x] `docs/front-matter-spec.md` — Documented MAF-native `read_skill_resource` pattern instead of includes
- [x] `samples/skill-includes-demo/` — Renamed conceptually to "skill resources demo", shows MAF-native pattern

## 8. Status & sign-off

- **Architecture review (phase 2):** Design updated to use temp directory approach for MAF integration (Agent, 2026-06-29)
- **Human sign-off:** User requested implementation (2026-06-29) → `status: Finalized`
- **Closure (2026-06-30):** After implementation, user reconsidered the design:
  - Concern: Extra I/O overhead (parsing SKILL.md for includes, writing to temp directory)
  - Goal: Allow agents to access reference content in nested directories
  - Resolution: MAF's native `read_skill_resource` already provides this via progressive disclosure
  - Decision: **Remove custom include feature, document MAF-native pattern instead**
  - Status: **Closed — not implemented**
