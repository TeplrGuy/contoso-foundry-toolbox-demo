# FRD 0007 — Multi-agent delegation (agent-as-tool)

## 1. Summary

> **TL;DR:** Today, an app can contain several agents, but users or app
> authors must route work between them. This feature lets one coordinator ask
> declared specialists for help, much like a lead asking subject-matter experts
> and then giving one final answer. It is the lighter coordination option: the
> coordinator stays in control, it uses an API already in the pinned dependency,
> and the runtime keeps one normal `agent.run()` path. True handoff, where a
> specialist takes control, is a committed fast-follow rather than part of v1.

v1 adds **delegation** to the markdown-first runtime. A coordinator
`*.agent.md` declares existing agents as specialists in a new `subagents:`
front-matter field. At runtime, the coordinator calls those specialists as
hand-written `delegate_<slug>` function tools, each of whose handler runs its
specialist through Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) `Agent.run()` — a plain,
non-streaming call, since a delegate only ever needs the specialist's final
answer back, never its streamed tokens. The user still interacts with "one
assistant that consults specialists, then answers."

Delegation needs **no new dependency**. `agent_framework.Agent`, its
non-streaming `run()`, and this repo's own existing `@tool` decorator all
already exist, unchanged, in the pinned `agent-framework-core==1.3.*`. It
fits the existing tool assembly, registration, and single-`agent.run()` path.

True **handoff** is different: control moves between agents through MAF's
`HandoffBuilder`, which returns a `Workflow`. Handoff is not part of v1. It is a
committed, chat-scoped fast-follow with its own FRD. This design prepares for
that work through stable participant identities, an immutable in-memory
`AgentCatalog`, and a reusable helper that builds a MAF `Agent` from a
`ResolvedAgent` for an explicit execution role. These choices avoid later
changes to the authoring surface or the per-`session_id` storage model.

Tracking issue: `Azure/azure-functions-bucees-planning#1185` — "[Serverless
Agents] Multi-agent: Handoff via HandoffBuilder + workflows
(agents.config.yaml)".

**Glossary**

- **MAF:** Microsoft Agent Framework, the agent library used by this runtime.
- **Coordinator:** the agent that receives the request, consults specialists, and gives the final answer.
- **Specialist / sub-agent:** an existing `*.agent.md` agent that the coordinator can call for focused work.
- **Delegation:** the coordinator calls a specialist as a tool and keeps control.
- **Handoff:** control transfers to another agent; this is the planned fast-follow.
- **`as_tool()`:** the MAF API that exposes an agent as a callable tool.
- **`direct` / `delegated` role:** the same agent entered through its endpoint or called as a coordinator tool.
- **Dynamic Workflows:** the repo's existing single-agent Durable Functions feature; it is not MAF multi-agent orchestration.

## 2. Motivation / problem

Today, each `*.agent.md` file registers independently with its own trigger(s)
and/or built-in endpoint(s). The runtime does not compose agents. The
`samples/multi-agent-folder` sample makes the user choose an endpoint, for
example by suggesting the research endpoint. An app author who wants automatic
routing must build it themselves.

Customers building AgentApps with several specialists want one agent to route
work automatically instead of exposing N endpoints and asking the user to
choose. The confirmed v1 interaction is **"one assistant throughout — it
consults specialists, then answers"** (Decisions log #2). The coordinator stays
in control. Delegation is therefore the smallest pattern that meets the need.
Both delegation and handoff are new to this runtime; nothing coordinates agents
today.

Two existing concepts use the word "workflow" but mean different things:

- This repo's **Dynamic Workflows** (FRD 0004, `docs/workflows.md`) are
  LLM-authored DAGs of tool calls. Durable Functions executes them. An agent
  opts in through `workflows.enabled` front matter, and the feature is
  explicitly single-agent.
- MAF's orchestration **`Workflow`** layer supports multi-agent control transfer
  and shared-context collaboration. `HandoffBuilder`, `GroupChatBuilder`, and
  `MagenticBuilder` all return a `Workflow`. True handoff uses
  `HandoffBuilder` and full-mesh shared broadcast context, so every participant
  sees the running conversation.

Delegation through `as_tool()` is the only MAF multi-agent pattern that runs
inside plain `agent.run()` with no `Workflow`. Because the two workflow concepts
are unrelated, this FRD must not reuse `workflows:` for its new field (Decisions
log #5). The future handoff FRD will add the MAF orchestration `Workflow` path.

The three routing patterns are:

1. **Manual routing (today):** separate endpoints; the user chooses.
2. **Delegation / agent-as-tool (`as_tool()`):** the coordinator stays in
   control, calls specialists as tools, and combines their work into the final
   answer. It uses plain `agent.run()` and no new dependency. **This is v1.**
3. **True handoff (`HandoffBuilder`):** control transfers to the specialist,
   which owns later turns. Participants share broadcast context. This needs a
   `Workflow` execution path and the `agent-framework-orchestrations`
   dependency. **This is the fast-follow.**

## 3. Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**

- Add an optional, object-only `subagents:` front-matter field. A coordinator
  can use it to declare one or more existing agents as specialists.
- Let the coordinator call each specialist as a `delegate_<slug>` function
  tool inside the existing `agent.run()` path, with no MAF `Workflow`.
- Run a specialist as itself in the **delegated** role: with its own
  instructions, model, static user tools, MCP servers, and skills.
  Request-scoped capabilities are naturally absent: a delegated call has no
  per-request sandbox of its own, and Dynamic-Workflow tools are already
  main-only. Delegation does not strip them.
- Add no dependency. Delegation needs only `agent_framework.Agent`,
  `Agent.run()`, and this repo's own existing `@tool` decorator — all
  present and unchanged in the pinned `agent-framework-core==1.3.*`.
- Make same-stem agent slugs **fail fast app-wide** (replacing today's silent
  auto-suffixing), so every agent has a unique slug — one collision contract,
  consistent with how the runtime already rejects duplicate skill and
  workflow-tool names. *(Breaking change — see §4 Compatibility and Decisions
  log #17.)*
- Use the existing `tool_start` and `tool_end` SSE events for delegated calls.
  The tool name is `delegate_<slug>`. Do not add an event type or require a
  client/UI change.
- Emit correlated, nested telemetry for delegated calls automatically (the
  runtime already enables MAF instrumentation), and add delegation-specific
  `af.*` attributes, metrics, and error accounting for parity with the existing
  system tools. *(See §4.12 and Decisions log #19.)*
- Establish reusable groundwork for the handoff fast-follow: stable participant
  identities, an immutable catalog, and role-based agent construction. Avoid
  coordinator-only APIs that handoff would have to replace.

**Non-goals**

- True handoff or control transfer through `HandoffBuilder`, or any MAF
  orchestration `Workflow` execution path.
- Workflow checkpointing plus `request_info` pause/resume across Function
  invocations.
- **Any human-in-the-loop (HITL) flow**, including tool approvals or user-input
  pause/resume. The runtime has none today. This was verified by finding no
  `user_input_requests`, `approval_mode`, `request_info`, or
  `UserInputRequired` handling in `src/`; `run_agent` awaits `agent.run(...)`
  once and has no approval loop. v1 specialists must use autonomous tools.
  HITL is deferred to the handoff fast-follow.
- Shared session/context, or shared-state tools, between coordinator and
  specialist (what MAF's `as_tool()` calls `propagate_session=True`). In v1 the
  specialist receives only the tool-call argument, not the coordinator's chat
  history.
- Nested delegation. v1 is single-level: a delegated specialist cannot delegate
  onward. This is a deliberate v1 boundary, not a permanent limit. A later
  bounded-nesting change can stay localized to agent construction, so v1 adds
  no depth-counter machinery.
- String shorthand such as `subagents: [billing, tech]`. v1 accepts only the
  object form. Shorthand can be added later as non-breaking sugar.

## 4. Proposed design

### 4.1 Runtime foundation

**TL;DR:** Delegation uses APIs already available in the pinned MAF package —
no new dependency, in either the first or the final v1 shape.

A delegate needs only two MAF primitives, both already present, unchanged,
in pinned `agent-framework-core==1.3.*` (verified at tag `python-1.3.0`):
`Agent(...)`, to build a specialist agent in the *delegated* role (§4.4), and
`Agent.run(task)`, the plain non-streaming coroutine — it returns an
`AgentResponse`, and `.text` is the specialist's final answer.

`BaseAgent.as_tool()` also exists, unchanged, on root `BaseAgent`:

```python
BaseAgent.as_tool(
    *,
    name=None,
    description=None,
    arg_name="task",
    arg_description=None,
    approval_mode="never_require",
    stream_callback=None,
    propagate_session=False,
) -> FunctionTool
```

The first v1 implementation called it directly. The final v1 shape (§5
Decision #20) does not: `as_tool()`'s own wrapper always runs the specialist
through `Agent.run(stream=True, ...)` internally and awaits
`stream.get_final_response()`, even though a delegate only ever needs that
final text back and never the specialist's streamed tokens (§4.12 — "SSE is
a black box at the boundary" was already a non-goal). Building the
`delegate_<slug>` tool by hand instead (§4.2, §4.8) and calling plain,
non-streaming `Agent.run(task)` directly avoids that unneeded streaming
machinery, and everything it otherwise forced on the implementation (see
Decision #20). Either way, no new dependency is needed.

### 4.2 Pipeline and two-pass composition

**TL;DR:** Resolve and validate all agents before registering any of them.

`subagents:` uses the existing four-stage pipeline from
`docs/architecture.md` §2: discover → translate → register → execute. The
runtime now needs a global view because one agent can refer to another.
Therefore, the app factory replaces its interleaved validate/register loop with
an explicit multi-pass order.

| Pipeline stage | Module(s) | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| discover | — | No change. Coordinators and specialists are ordinary `*.agent.md` files found by the existing top-level and `agents/` folder scan (FRD 0001). Discovery stays read-only. |
| translate | `config/schema.py`, `config/merge.py`, `config/validation.py` | Add `SubagentRef` (`{agent, when?}`) and `AgentSpec.subagents: list[SubagentRef] \| None`. Carry `subagents` and the resolved identity (`agent_id`, the file-stem slug) onto `ResolvedAgent`. `merge.py` normalizes and validates each reference, and derives canonical identity from the file-stem slug. `validation.py` uses the complete global index. It rejects **duplicate agent slugs (app-wide, fail-fast)**, unknown/duplicate/self references, and tool-name collisions. It relaxes the trigger-or-`builtin_endpoints` rule for a referenced internal specialist. |
| register | `app.py`, `registration/_handlers.py`, `registration/endpoints.py`, `registration/_naming.py` | `app.py` becomes the composition root. It builds the identity index (slug → agent) and **fails fast if two agents share a slug** (`_naming.py` now rejects duplicates instead of auto-suffixing). After capabilities and capability-aware validation, it builds the read-only `AgentCatalog` (`agent_id -> (ResolvedAgent, AgentCapabilities)`) and the global referenced-subagent set. All of this happens before any `FunctionApp` mutation. `_handlers.py` and `endpoints.py` pass read-only catalog data, not live MAF agents, into `run_agent` and `run_agent_stream` for coordinators with `subagents`. Registration parses no YAML/front matter and resolves no references; it consumes validated data. |
| execute | `runner.py`, `_observability.py` | Add `build_subagent_tools(subagents, catalog)`. For each reference, build one hand-written `delegate_<slug>` `FunctionTool` (`_build_delegate_tool` — the same `@tool(schema=...)` pattern this repo already uses for the `web_request`/`execute_python` system tools, **not** MAF's `BaseAgent.as_tool()`) whose schema is `{task: str}` with a fixed `arg_description`, name `delegate_<slug>`, and description `<when \| specialist description>`. Its handler builds the specialist's MAF `Agent` in the `delegated` role — through the shared role-based client/tool assembly path — FRESH on every call (not once when the tool is built) and awaits its plain, non-streaming `agent.run(task)` directly. `ClientManager` creates the chat client for the specialist's own resolved model while reusing provider and credential state process-wide. Append the resulting tools to the coordinator's `resolved_tools`. Build the tool wrapper eagerly, but build/run the specialist `Agent` only if the coordinator selects it. The handler also emits `af.delegate.*` span attributes and delegate call/error metrics, and marks a recoverable delegated failure for correct tool-error accounting (see §4.12). Because each call gets its own, unshared specialist `Agent`, there is no per-specialist lock (see §5 Decision #20). |

The ordered composition pipeline is:

1. Resolve every discovered agent into a typed `ResolvedAgent`.
2. Build the identity index (slug → agent) and the global set of referenced
   ids. Two agents that resolve to the same slug are a fail-fast error here.
3. Validate schema and references against that index: unknown, duplicate, and
   self-references; tool-name collisions; and the internal-specialist rule.
4. Build `AgentCapabilities` for each agent.
5. Run capability-aware validation, including tool-name checks against each
   coordinator's known tool set.
6. Build the read-only runtime `AgentCatalog`:
   `agent_id → (ResolvedAgent, AgentCapabilities)`.
7. Mutate the single `FunctionApp` by adding triggers and built-in endpoints.

An early agent can depend on a later one. For example, a triggerless internal
specialist is valid only if another agent references it. The ordered pipeline
keeps validity independent of discovery order and prevents partial Azure
registration before global validation finishes. Cross-agent awareness in steps
2–5 is the only genuinely new plumbing requirement; current validation rules
are local to one agent.

Tool-name collision validation runs once, at composition (step 5); it is not
re-checked at request time. The one category composition can't see — an MCP
server's individually expanded remote functions, unknown until the server
connects — is backstopped by MAF's own tool assembly, which independently
rejects a duplicate name there.

### 4.3 Participant identity (Decisions log #9)

**TL;DR:** A specialist is referenced by its file-stem slug, and every agent's slug is unique — the app fails fast at startup if two collide.

Each agent's identity for `subagents` references is its **file-stem slug**:
`billing.agent.md` becomes `billing`. Translation derives it from the file stem
the same way `_naming.py` derives slugs. Because duplicate slugs now fail fast
app-wide (see below and Decisions log #17), a reference resolves to exactly one
agent — there is no suffixing to disambiguate against. (There is no separate
`id` field in v1 — see Decisions log #16.)

Slugs are **globally unique**. Two agents that resolve to the same slug — e.g.
one in the app root and one in `agents/`, or two names that sanitize to the same
slug — are a **fail-fast startup error** ("rename one of these files"). This
replaces today's silent auto-suffixing and makes agent-slug handling consistent
with how the runtime already rejects duplicate skill and workflow-tool names
(Decisions log #17; this is a breaking change — see *Compatibility*).

Because slugs are unique, a `subagents` reference resolves to exactly one agent
or fails as an "unknown reference" — no ambiguity handling is needed. Display
`name` is never an identity.

### 4.4 Direct and delegated execution roles (Decisions log #13)

**TL;DR:** A delegated specialist is the same agent with its own configuration, entered through a different path.

A referenced specialist remains an ordinary `*.agent.md` agent. It runs with
its own instructions, model, timeout, static user tools, MCP servers, and
skills. Delegation does not copy coordinator tools onto it or remove its static
tools. The delegate tool's handler runs the specialist `Agent` unchanged — a
plain `agent.run(task)` call, as verified against `agent_framework` source.
The same full-capability pattern appears in
the surveyed OpenAI Agents SDK, LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, and Google ADK.

| Capability | `direct` role | `delegated` role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entry point | Own trigger or endpoint | Coordinator's `delegate_<slug>` tool call |
| Instructions, model, timeout, static tools, MCP, skills | Specialist's own | Specialist's own |
| Per-request sandbox | Attached by the top-level handler | No new sandbox session |
| Dynamic-Workflow tools | Main-agent-only rule applies | Absent because they are already main-only |
| Conversation context | Direct request/session behavior | Only the `task` string; no `session=` argument passed at all |
| Own `subagents` | Full direct-role behavior | Not wired in v1 |

The sandbox/code-interpreter is request-scoped. A trigger or endpoint handler
attaches it with `build_sandbox_tools_for_session`, using an ACA session id
created for that top-level invocation. A delegated call is not another
top-level request, so it opens no specialist sandbox session. A separate
delegated sandbox session could be a future enhancement.

Dynamic-Workflow tools are scoped by each workflow-enabled agent's policy under
FRD 0004, so delegation does not need a separate removal rule.

Conversation history is also isolated: the delegate tool's handler calls
`agent.run(task)` with no `session=` argument at all, so the specialist
receives only the `task` string and never the coordinator's history or any
other shared state. This mirrors the standard default in OpenAI, LangGraph,
and AutoGen (and, when the delegate tool was first implemented via MAF's
`as_tool()`, its own `propagate_session=False` default, which had the same
effect). The coordinator includes needed context in the task.

One reusable helper builds a MAF `Agent` from a `ResolvedAgent`, parameterized
by the `direct` or `delegated` execution role. It never mutates
`ResolvedAgent`. Therefore, the same specialist still gets its complete direct
capabilities through its own endpoint.

### 4.5 Delegation depth

**TL;DR:** v1 permits one coordinator-to-specialist level and removes recursion structurally.

When the runtime builds a specialist for the `delegated` role, it does not wire that
specialist's own `subagents`. The resulting agent has no `delegate_*` tools.
There is no runtime refusal or cycle check because the capability is absent.
Mutual references are therefore safe: A may reference B and B may reference A,
but neither expands the other's references during delegation.

Single-level delegation matches the confirmed interaction and common
coordinator-to-specialist designs. Google ADK's `task`/`single_turn` modes use
single-level "leaf agents"; CrewAI's default path is effectively single-level.
MAF itself has no recursion, depth, or cycle guard. Its only runaway bound is a
per-run limit of about 40 iterations, which does not compose across nesting
levels. A future nested design must therefore add its own bound.

Deeper composition remains a natural extension. Mature frameworks use small
budgets rather than free recursion: Anthropic caps sub-agent nesting at 5,
LangGraph uses `recursion_limit=25`, and ADK uses global `max_llm_calls`.
Because v1's block is one construction decision, future bounded nesting can be
a localized builder change: wire `subagents` below a limit and pass depth+1.
v1 adds no depth counter, and `AgentCatalog` and `run_agent` need no change now
to preserve that option.

The single-level guarantee covers native `subagents` expansion. An arbitrary
MCP or user tool could still call another endpoint over HTTP. That behavior is
outside delegation's control.

### 4.6 Failure, timeout, and cancellation (Decisions log #12)

**TL;DR:** Child failures return to the coordinator; parent cancellation stops the request.

The runtime treats two failure classes differently:

- **Specialist failure or specialist-local timeout is recoverable.** This
  covers a failure *building* the specialist `Agent` (e.g. a misconfigured
  specialist model) just as much as a failure or timeout from actually
  *running* it — both are inside the same recoverable-failure boundary, so
  neither can propagate unhandled out of the tool call. Return it
  as a recoverable tool error in `tool_end`. The coordinator can retry, choose
  another route, or apologize.
- **Parent or request cancellation propagates.** A coordinator-turn timeout,
  client disconnect, or host shutdown cancels the coordinator and all in-flight
  delegated calls. Do not turn it into a recoverable tool result.

The effective specialist timeout is
`min(specialist timeout, coordinator's remaining budget)`. The recoverable path
returns a stable, sanitized string to the model/client. Internal telemetry keeps
full diagnostic detail: redacted exception type, correlation id, and outcome.
Existing SSE order remains `tool_start` then `tool_end`, with recoverable errors
inside the `tool_end` result.

A thin, hand-written handler guarantees this split (§5 Decision #20) — it
does not rely on or wrap pinned `as_tool()` behavior; it builds the
specialist `Agent` and awaits its plain, non-streaming `Agent.run(task)`
directly inside `asyncio.wait_for`, both inside the same `try`, catching
`asyncio.CancelledError` separately from `TimeoutError`/`Exception`. Because
each call builds its own specialist `Agent` instance (§4.7), no
per-specialist serialization is needed either — see §4.11.

### 4.7 Build live agents per delegate tool-call

**TL;DR:** Cache immutable definitions and shared clients, but build each live MAF agent fresh for every request — and, for a specialist, fresh for every individual `delegate_<slug>` tool CALL, not merely once per request.

Do not build specialists once at startup:

- Some state exists only for a request. A top-level agent's sandbox uses a
  one-time secure session, and conversation history belongs to one user's chat.
  A startup agent would need per-call patching, which defeats caching.
- A MAF `Agent` is mutable, not a frozen share-safe object. On first use,
  `agent.run()` attaches an in-memory history provider to the instance. This was
  confirmed in pinned `agent-framework-core==1.3.*` and remains true upstream.
  One warm Functions worker can serve concurrent requests, so sharing one live
  agent would create the race class already guarded by the per-session lock.
- Fresh construction is cheap. `ClientManager` already reuses the expensive
  model client process-wide. A lightweight `Agent` wrapper adds little work,
  prevents cross-request state sharing, and uses less cold-start time and memory
  than pre-building every agent.

The runtime caches `AgentCatalog` (`ResolvedAgent` + `AgentCapabilities`) and
the shared client. It builds the coordinator `Agent` object once per request,
matching today's execution model. A delegated specialist's `Agent` object,
though, is built fresh on every individual `delegate_<slug>` tool CALL — by
the tool's own handler, not by `build_subagent_tools`/`_build_delegate_tool`
at tool-assembly time (§5 Decision #20). Only the cheap `FunctionTool`
wrapper (schema + closure) is built once, when the coordinator's tools are
assembled; the specialist `Agent` itself is not, so two calls to the same
declared specialist — even concurrent ones — never share a live agent
instance and need no lock (§4.11).

### 4.8 Authoring and routing

**TL;DR:** Coordinators declare object-form specialist references with an optional routing hint.

`subagents` is an optional per-agent front-matter field:

```yaml
# agents/coordinator.agent.md
---
name: Support Coordinator          # human-readable display name (not identity)
description: Routes customer questions to the right specialist
builtin_endpoints: true
subagents:
  - agent: billing                 # references billing.agent.md by its slug
    when: Invoices, charges, refunds, or subscription questions   # -> becomes delegate_billing's tool description
  - agent: tech                    # when omitted → uses tech's own `description`
---
You are a support coordinator. Use the billing and tech specialists when
relevant, then give the customer a single consolidated answer.
```

`SubagentRef` has two fields:

- **`agent`** is required and names the specialist by slug.
- **`when`** is an optional routing hint. It defaults to the specialist's own
  required `description`.

The coordinator model reads `when` to decide whether to call a specialist.
Routing is **model-selected, not deterministic**. A weak hint can skip
delegation or route incorrectly; this is an accepted limitation.

The delegated tool is named `delegate_<slug>`. That name must be a valid
identifier and unique in the coordinator's final tool set. A collision with a
user, MCP, sandbox, workflow, or another specialist tool fails fast and is never
silently suffixed, because the name is a prompt-visible API. Validation runs
once, during capability-aware validation at composition; MAF's own tool
assembly backstops the one category composition can't see (an MCP server's
individually expanded remote functions).

Construct the specialist's `FunctionTool` wrapper while assembling one
invocation's coordinator tools; the specialist `Agent` itself is not built
there — its handler builds one fresh on every call (§4.7, §5 Decision #20).
`ClientManager` builds each specialist client for that specialist's own
resolved model and reuses provider/credential state process-wide. Do not
cache mutable MAF agents between Functions requests, or between calls within
one request. Declaring a specialist creates one cheap wrapper and adds its
schema to the coordinator prompt; the specialist's model does not run until
selected. Prompt-visible tool-schema size is the real cost of declaring many
specialists.

These fields are front-matter-only. They have no `agents.config.yaml`
equivalent, so there is no global/front-matter merge or precedence rule as there
is for `model`, `timeout`, and `tools`. This follows
`docs/front-matter-spec.md`; §7 covers documentation and reference regeneration.

### 4.9 Task and context contract

**TL;DR:** The coordinator must send a self-contained task because no conversation history is shared implicitly.

The `delegate_<slug>` tool's schema gives the specialist one string argument
named `task`. Its description tells the coordinator to send a self-contained
request. Isolation does not mean that no data can move: the coordinator must
include all needed context in this string.

No session id or mutable state dictionary is shared either — the handler's
`agent.run(task)` call passes no `session=` argument at all. The specialist's
output returns only as the coordinator's `tool_end` result.

### 4.10 HITL and trust boundary

**TL;DR:** Specialists run autonomously inside the coordinator's app trust boundary.

The runtime has no approval or user-input flow today, so v1 uses
`approval_mode="never_require"`. A specialist tool that requires approval, or a
specialist that raises `UserInputRequiredException`, cannot pause or surface a
question to the user. Such tools are unsupported in v1 specialists. Real HITL
(pause → ask → resume) belongs to the handoff fast-follow.

`subagents` is an explicit **capability grant** from the app author. A delegated
call runs in-process and does not pass through the specialist endpoint's
authorization. Anyone who can invoke the coordinator effectively gains access
to the declared specialist's tools, MCP servers, and skills; prompt injection
can widen that exposure. v1 treats one deployed app as one trust domain and
relies on the declaration. Specialist opt-in, such as a `delegatable` flag or
allow-list, is possible future hardening, not v1.

### 4.11 Breadth and concurrency (Decisions log #14)

**TL;DR:** Declare any number of specialists; every call — different specialists or repeated calls to the same one — runs independently and in parallel.

v1 sets no hard cap on declared specialists. MAF's tool-calling loop bounds the
number of delegations in one turn. Different specialists always run in
parallel. So do concurrent calls to the *same* specialist: each
`delegate_<slug>` call builds its own specialist `Agent` instance fresh
(§4.7, §5 Decision #20) rather than sharing or reusing one built at
tool-assembly time, so there is no shared, mutable `Agent` for concurrent
calls to race on in the first place — v1 needs no per-specialist lock and no
assumption about whether a delegated `Agent` is reentrant, because no two
calls ever share one.

Delegated calls are ephemeral and have no persistent session: the handler's
`agent.run(task)` call passes no `session=` argument at all, so a specialist
never sees the coordinator's conversation history or any other shared state.
They do not contend for the coordinator session lock, which serializes turns
rather than tool calls inside one turn. The only shared components are
process-wide `ClientManager` and per-app cached MCP tool objects. Both are
already shared across concurrent top-level requests, so delegation adds no
new cross-request sharing model. Tests cover parallel specialists and
repeated, concurrent calls to one specialist, each running independently on
its own instance.

### 4.12 Observability

**TL;DR:** Tracing is automatic — the runtime already enables MAF instrumentation, so a delegated call emits a nested span tree under one App Insights `OperationId` with no new tracing code. v1 adds delegation-specific `af.*` attributes, metrics, and correct error accounting; token totals still do not roll up across the boundary, and the SSE stream shows the delegate call as a black box.

**Automatic today.** The runtime bootstraps OpenTelemetry once
(`_observability.py`, from `create_function_app()`): it calls MAF's
`enable_instrumentation()` and, when `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` and
the `[monitor]` extra are present, wires the Azure Monitor exporter (a no-op
otherwise). Every run is already wrapped in a runtime `agent.run {name}` span
with `af.*` attributes. Because the hand-written `delegate_<slug>` tool's
handler calls the specialist's plain `Agent.run(task)` directly, and MAF
traces every `Agent.run()` and every `FunctionTool.invoke()`, a delegated
call produces this tree with **no new tracing code**:

```
agent.run {coordinator}              runtime span (af.*)
└─ invoke_agent {coordinator}        MAF
   ├─ chat {model}                   the routing decision
   └─ execute_tool delegate_<slug>   the delegation (an ordinary tool span)
      └─ invoke_agent {specialist}   auto-nested
         └─ chat {model}             the specialist's own model call
```

All spans share one trace, so Application Insights ties the chain under a single
`OperationId`. Nesting is by in-process OpenTelemetry context (`contextvars`):
the Functions Python worker attaches the invocation's `traceparent` before the
handler runs, and `asyncio.gather` copies the current context into each task, so
**concurrent specialists nest correctly** as long as `gather` runs while the
coordinator span is current (it does — delegation happens inside `agent.run`).
The only requirement is that a specialist is a real `agent_framework.Agent`; the
`delegated`-role builder path already constructs one (a `RawAgent` would carry no
telemetry layer). Correlating attributes come for free: `gen_ai.agent.name` (the
specialist slug, app-qualified when a non-blank Function App site name is available;
canonical delegation identity stays the slug), `gen_ai.tool.name` (`delegate_<slug>`), model, per-span token
usage, and duration. (Runtime logs go to the `azure.functions.AgentRuntime`
system logger, which the Functions worker does not surface in App Insights
`traces`; spans, not logs, are the debugging surface.)

**Added in v1.** For parity with the existing system tools (sandbox,
web_request), the `delegate_<slug>` tool's handler enriches the delegate call:
- `af.delegate.*` span attributes (at least the specialist slug and outcome) on
  the `execute_tool delegate_<slug>` span, a dedicated `FaultDomain` value for a
  failed delegated call, and delegate call/error **metrics** parallel to
  `record_sandbox_execution` / `record_web_request`. The call metric is
  recorded on every dispatched attempt, including one stopped by a parent/
  request cancellation (`outcome=cancelled`) — cancellation is exempt only
  from the *error* counter (Decision #12), never from the call counter, so a
  cancelled delegate call is never invisible to call-volume metrics.
- Correct error accounting: today `_looks_like_tool_error` expects a JSON
  `{"error": …}` / `stderr` envelope (the sandbox/web_request shape) and would
  mis-count a specialist's sanitized free-text failure (§4.6, Decision #12). The
  handler marks a recoverable delegated failure explicitly so it lands
  in `af.agent.tool_error_count` rather than relying on that heuristic.

**Accepted limitations.**
- **SSE is a black box at the boundary.** The coordinator stream emits
  `tool_start`/`tool_end` for the `delegate_<slug>` call (task in, final text
  out), exactly like the sandbox/web_request tools. The specialist's internal
  deltas and nested tool calls do not surface unless a MAF `stream_callback` is
  wired into `run_agent_stream` — out of scope for v1.
- **Token usage does not roll up across the boundary.** MAF records usage
  per-run on each `invoke_agent`/`chat` span; the `execute_tool` span carries no
  usage, and a specialist's tokens are not merged into the coordinator's span. A
  combined per-request total must be summed from the child spans in the backend
  (by trace). Documented, not changed in v1.

**Sampling guidance (docs).** For delegation-heavy apps, prefer
`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=parentbased_traceidratio` with an explicit
`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG`. Azure Monitor's default rate-limited sampler counts
spans, and one fan-out turn (coordinator + N specialists + MAF's own child spans)
can exhaust the budget and drop whole traces under load. Its sampler is
trace-id-deterministic, so a decision applies consistently across the whole
nested trace (no half-traces); logs on a dropped trace are dropped with it.

### 4.13 Compatibility and handoff groundwork

**TL;DR:** Adding `subagents` is additive, but one change is breaking — same-stem agent slugs now fail fast instead of auto-suffixing.

Adding `subagents` is additive: apps that omit it behave as before, and
`GlobalConfig`/`AgentSpec` keep `extra="forbid"`, so unrelated unknown keys still
fail fast.

**One deliberate breaking change (Decisions log #17):** two agent files that
resolve to the same slug — e.g. `billing.agent.md` in both the app root and
`agents/`, or names that sanitize identically — now cause a **fail-fast startup
error** instead of today's silent auto-suffixing (`billing`, `billing_2`).
Migration is a one-line fix: rename one file. This unifies the collision
contract app-wide (matching duplicate skill/workflow-tool handling) and is what
lets `subagents` references resolve unambiguously — but because it can reject a
previously-booting app, it must be called out in release notes.

The implementation is not zero-touch: the app factory changes to two-pass
composition, validation gains cross-agent rules, and `_naming.py` changes from
auto-suffix to fail-fast. Regression tests must cover existing no-subagent
registration names, triggers, endpoints, and tool assembly, plus the new
fail-fast path.

The field is not named `workflows:` for the reasons in §2 and Decisions log #5.
Stable identities, immutable `AgentCatalog`, and the role-based agent builder
are reusable for handoff. They are not all that handoff needs:
`HandoffBuilder` also requires a `Workflow` execution path, checkpointing,
session ownership, request-info/HITL, and event semantics. The handoff FRD owns
that work.

Delegation and handoff will coexist and compose (Decisions log #7). An app may
mix delegating coordinators with handoff coordinators. After the fast-follow, a
handoff participant may itself declare `subagents` and delegate.

| # | Decision | Options considered | Choice | Decided by | Date |
| - | -------- | ------------------ | ------ | ---------- | ---- |
| 1 | v1 pattern | manual routing / delegation (`as_tool`) / true handoff (`HandoffBuilder`) | **Delegation** | Human (user) | 2026-07-14 |
| 2 | Target interaction | "one assistant throughout" vs "specialist takes over" | **One assistant throughout** (→ delegation) | Human (user) | 2026-07-14 |
| 3 | Dependency for v1 | none (`as_tool` in core 1.3.x) / orchestrations beta / orchestrations stable + core bump | **None** (use `as_tool`, no new dep — mechanism later revised by #20, conclusion unchanged: still no new dependency) | Agent (proposed) | 2026-07-14 |
| 4 | Handoff disposition | drop / "maybe later" / committed fast-follow / v1 preview | **Committed fast-follow, chat-scoped, designed-for in v1** | Human (user) | 2026-07-14 |
| 5 | Authoring field name | `subagents` / `delegates_to` / `agents` / reuse `workflows` | **`subagents`** (avoids `workflows` collision) | Human (user) | 2026-07-15 |
| 6 | Mutual / peer references (A↔B) | reject cycles / single-level (structural) / nested + depth cap | **Single-level in v1**, enforced structurally (a delegated specialist has no `delegate_*` tools wired), so mutual refs are benign and no cycle detection is needed; nesting is a later extension | Human (user) | 2026-07-14 |
| 7 | Delegation vs handoff coexistence | either-or / both coexist + compose | **Coexist + compose** (a handoff participant may itself declare `subagents` and delegate) | Human (user) | 2026-07-14 |
| 8 | HITL in v1 | support / none | **None** — no HITL/approval exists in the runtime today (verified); v1 sub-agents run autonomously; HITL is net-new and lands with the handoff fast-follow | Agent (proposed — confirm) | 2026-07-14 |
| 9 | Participant identity | file-stem slug only / display `name` / stable `id` field / relative path | **File-stem slug only** (no `id` field — see #16); computed pre-registration; slugs are globally unique — any collision fails fast at startup (see #17) — so a reference resolves to exactly one agent | Human (user) | 2026-07-15 |
| 10 | Delegation trust model | coordinator-authority / specialist opt-in / auth-level guardrail | **Coordinator-authority** — `subagents` is an author capability grant; one app = one trust domain; specialist endpoint auth not consulted | Human (user) | 2026-07-14 |
| 11 | `subagents` schema shape | object-only / string-list / mixed `str \| SubagentRef` union | **Object-only `SubagentRef`** with fields `{agent, when?}` (see #16); string shorthand deferrable later as non-breaking sugar | Human (user) | 2026-07-14 |
| 12 | Delegated failure / timeout / cancellation | abort coordinator / recoverable tool error / split the two classes | **Split**: child failure or specialist-local timeout → recoverable `tool_end` error; parent/request cancellation → propagate + abort; effective timeout = `min(specialist, coordinator remaining)`; stable sanitized error to the model, full detail to telemetry | Agent (proposed — confirm) | 2026-07-14 |
| 13 | How a specialist runs when delegated (the delegated role) | strip a delegated agent's tools / inherit-then-restrict / **runs as itself** with request-scoped caps naturally absent | **Runs as itself** — own instructions/model/static tools/MCP/skills, via a builder `direct`/`delegated` execution-role param (no mutation); sandbox is per-request and Dynamic-Workflow tools are already main-only, so both are *naturally* absent from a delegated call rather than stripped; context isolated (`propagate_session=False`) per industry-standard default | Agent (proposed — confirm) | 2026-07-15 |
| 14 | Delegation breadth / concurrency | no cap / explicit caps / serialize calls | **No hard cap**; different specialists run in parallel. **Revised by #20:** each delegate call builds its own specialist instance, so calls — including repeated calls to the same specialist — run in parallel with no shared-instance lock; per-turn count bounded by MAF's tool loop; prompt-schema size is the documented cost | Human (user) | 2026-07-14 |
| 15 | Delegated-role capability scope, re-examined via cross-framework research | keep original restrictive framing / drop restrictions / reframe | **Reframe** — a survey of MAF + OpenAI, Anthropic, LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, and Google ADK confirmed MAF imposes *none* of the originally-drafted restrictions and that a delegated sub-agent running with its own tools is the universal norm. Dropped the "workflow-tool strip" (redundant with FRD 0004's main-only gating); reframed sandbox/context as request-scoped defaults, not restrictions; kept **single-level** (#6) as the one real delegation rule — enforced structurally (a delegated specialist has no `delegate_*` tools wired), precedented (ADK task-mode, CrewAI), with bounded nesting left as a localized future change | Human (user) | 2026-07-15 |
| 16 | Drop `id` and `tool_name` for v1 (simplicity) | keep both / drop both / drop one | **Drop both** — identity is the file-stem slug (collisions fail fast app-wide — see #17); the delegated tool is always `delegate_<slug>`. Removes a field and the id/name/slug confusion; both are re-addable later as non-breaking additions if a real need appears | Human (user) | 2026-07-15 |
| 17 | Same-stem slug collision handling (base runtime) | keep auto-suffix+warn / fail-fast app-wide / open separate issue | **Fail-fast app-wide** — replace `_naming.py`'s silent auto-suffix with a startup error, unifying the contract with duplicate skill/workflow-tool handling and guaranteeing unique slugs for `subagents` references. **Breaking**: existing apps with same-stem files must rename one (release-note item) | Human (user) | 2026-07-15 |
| 18 | Who may declare `subagents` | any independently runnable agent / main-agent-only (mirror FRD 0004 `workflows.enabled`) | **Any independently runnable agent** may declare `subagents`. Single-level (#6) still applies, so when that agent is itself invoked as a sub-agent its `subagents` are not wired and it cannot delegate onward. Simpler than a main/non-main split and matches the cross-framework norm (#15) | Human (user) | 2026-07-15 |
| 19 | Observability approach | new bespoke tracing / rely on existing auto-instrumentation + add delegation enrichment / defer all enrichment | **Rely on auto-instrumentation, add delegation enrichment** — the runtime already enables MAF `gen_ai` spans and Azure Monitor export (`_observability.py`), and the delegate tool calling `Agent.run()` (originally via `as_tool()`→`run()`; the hand-written tool added by #20 calls `run()` directly, same effect) + `FunctionTool.invoke()` auto-nest a delegated call under one trace/`OperationId` with no new tracing code (verified against MAF tag `python-1.3.0` and the Functions Python worker's context attach). v1 additionally adds `af.delegate.*` attributes, delegate metrics, and explicit delegated-error accounting for parity with sandbox/web_request. Token roll-up across the boundary and SSE stream-through of specialist internals are documented limitations | Human (user) | 2026-07-15 |
| 20 | Delegate execution mechanism, revisited post-implementation | keep `as_tool()` + per-specialist `asyncio.Lock` + `specialist_agent.run` monkeypatch/stream-capture (as first implemented, #1/#3) / rewrite as a hand-written non-streaming `@tool(schema=...)` function tool, building a fresh specialist `Agent` per call | **Hand-written non-streaming tool, built fresh per call** — a delegate only ever needs the specialist's final text (§4.12's "SSE is a black box at the boundary" was already a non-goal), so there is no reason to run the specialist through `Agent.run(stream=True, ...)` at all, which is all `as_tool()`'s own `_agent_wrapper` ever did internally before `await`-ing `stream.get_final_response()` back into one string anyway. That streaming requirement was the *only* reason the first implementation needed to monkeypatch `specialist_agent.run` (to capture the `ResponseStream` `as_tool()` builds internally, so it could be force-finalized on timeout/cancellation — `ResponseStream.__anext__`'s cleanup hooks only fire from its own `except StopAsyncIteration`/`except Exception` branches, never `BaseException`) and, because the specialist `Agent` object was shared across calls in a turn, to serialize concurrent same-specialist calls behind a per-specialist `asyncio.Lock` so that monkeypatch rebind was race-free. Switching to plain, non-streaming `agent.run(task)` — verified against installed `agent-framework-core==1.3.0` (`AgentTelemetryLayer._run`, `ChatTelemetryLayer._get_response` in `agent_framework.observability`) to close its OTel spans deterministically on *any* exception, `asyncio.CancelledError` included, via the ordinary `with`/context-manager `__exit__` guarantee (no `BaseException` gap like the streaming path has) — removes the need to capture or finalize a stream at all. Building the specialist `Agent` fresh on every call, instead of once per tool-build and reused, removes the shared mutable state the lock existed to protect, so the lock is removed too: same-specialist calls now simply run in parallel, each on its own instance (revises #14). Net result: less code, a cleaner and more debuggable per-call span timeline (each specialist run's span opens/closes at one well-defined point per call, on every path — success, recoverable failure, timeout, cancel), and no behavior change visible to the coordinator or its model | Human (user) | 2026-07-16 |
| 21 | Readable MAF agent name | slug only / Function App name + slug / full correlation key + slug | **Function App name + slug** from non-blank `WEBSITE_SITE_NAME`, otherwise preserve the existing MAF name; the full stable `gen_ai.agent.id` and canonical delegation identity remain unchanged | Human (user) | 2026-10-02 |
| 22 | Simplified MAF agent ID | owner/deployment correlation key + slug / Function App site name + slug | Use trimmed, lower-case `WEBSITE_SITE_NAME` + canonical filename-derived slug, or `local/<slug>` when site name is blank; remove owner/deployment inputs. Readable name casing and canonical delegation identity remain unchanged. Supersedes #21's unchanged-ID statement. | Human (user) | 2026-10-05 |

## 6. Test plan

- [ ] Unit: `schema` — `SubagentRef` object form parses (fields `agent`, optional
      `when`); `extra="forbid"` remains; v1 rejects string shorthand.
- [ ] Unit: `merge` — normalize `subagents`; derive identity from the file-stem
      slug.
- [ ] Unit: `validation` / `_naming.py` — **fail fast on any duplicate agent
      slug app-wide** (same stem in root vs `agents/`, or names that sanitize
      alike), with an actionable rename error naming both files (replaces the
      old auto-suffix behavior); also reject unknown, duplicate, and
      self-references; accept A↔B with no cycle rejection; accept a referenced
      endpoint-less internal specialist regardless of file order.
- [ ] Unit: tool-name collision — fail fast when `delegate_<slug>`
      collides with coordinator user/MCP/sandbox/workflow tools or another
      specialist. Checked once, during capability-aware validation.
- [ ] Unit: `runner` / delegated role — assemble the hand-written `delegate_<slug>`
      specialist tool and return a result. Verify that a delegated specialist uses its own
      instructions, model, static user/MCP/skills tools; lacks a per-request
      sandbox and main-only workflow tools; and does not expand its own
      `subagents`. Verify the same agent in the direct role keeps its full
      capabilities.
- [ ] Unit: single-level structure — inspect the delegated specialist's tool
      list and confirm it has no `delegate_*` tools. Confirm A↔B cannot recurse
      without relying on a runtime guard.
- [ ] Unit: failure and cancellation — return specialist exceptions and local
      timeouts as sanitized recoverable `tool_end` errors without aborting the
      coordinator. Propagate parent/request cancellation and abort. Enforce
      `min(specialist, coordinator remaining)` timeout.
- [ ] Unit: concurrency — two concurrent calls to the *same* specialist each
      build and run on their own independent instance, in parallel, both
      producing correct results (no shared-instance lock — #20); calls to
      different specialists also run in parallel; verify every result.
- [ ] Observability — with instrumentation enabled, one delegated call produces
      nested `execute_tool delegate_<slug>` and `invoke_agent {specialist}` spans
      under the coordinator's `agent.run` span, all sharing one trace id;
      specialists dispatched via `asyncio.gather` nest under the coordinator span
      (context captured at gather time).
- [ ] Observability — a recoverable delegated failure increments
      `af.agent.tool_error_count`, sets the delegate `af.*`/`FaultDomain`
      attributes, and is not mis-classified by `_looks_like_tool_error`; delegate
      call/error metrics are recorded.
- [ ] Fixture: add
      `tests/fixtures/config_scenarios/<nn_delegation>/` with one coordinator
      and two specialists, including one endpoint-less internal specialist.
      Cover object form and app-wide duplicate-slug rejection at startup.
- [ ] Regression: existing collision-free no-subagent fixtures resolve and
      register identically under two-pass composition (triggers, endpoints, and
      tool assembly unchanged). A fixture with duplicate stems now fails fast at
      startup (previously auto-suffixed).
- [ ] Sample: add `samples/multi-agent-delegation/` with a coordinator and two
      specialists, one endpoint-less/internal. Show a self-contained `task`.

## 7. Docs impact

- [ ] `docs/front-matter-spec.md` — document object-form `subagents:`
      and the delegated role. Regenerate `docs/front-matter-reference.md` with
      `python eng/scripts/generate_config_reference.py`, then run the
      `update-schema-docs` skill to sync examples.
- [ ] `docs/architecture.md` — document two-pass composition, immutable
      `AgentCatalog`, and `direct`/`delegated` roles in the module map and
      pipeline. Add the coordination concept and distinguish it from Dynamic
      Workflows (FRD 0004).
- [ ] `docs/observability.md` — document the delegated-call span tree and
      `af.delegate.*` conventions, the token-rollup limitation, and sampling
      guidance (`parentbased_traceidratio`) for delegation-heavy apps.
- [ ] `docs/triggers.md` — explain that an otherwise triggerless/endpoint-less
      agent is valid only when another agent globally references it as an
      internal specialist.
- [ ] `README.md` — add a `subagents:` quickstart with the trust boundary and
      self-contained-`task` guidance.
- [ ] `docs/frds/README.md` — add FRD 0007 to the index.

## 8. Status & sign-off

- **Architecture review (phase 2): Complete (agent review).** Three
  `rubber-duck` passes are complete. **R1** (v1) drove two-pass composition,
  stable identity, tool-name collisions, failure semantics, delegated-role
  capability scope, and the trust boundary. **R2** (v2) drove catalog/capability
  ordering, the identity-collision model, corrected `Agent` construction timing,
  the failure/cancellation split, phased validation, and the breadth/concurrency
  decision (#14). **R3** (v3.1) confirmed the index construction, per-model
  client construction, and per-specialist concurrency serialization.
  A later cross-framework research pass covered MAF `as_tool()` internals plus
  OpenAI, Anthropic, LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, and Google ADK. It confirmed
  that MAF imposes none of the original delegated-role restrictions and that a
  full-capability delegated specialist is the universal norm. §4 and Decisions
  log #13/#15 were reframed accordingly. A follow-up simplification then dropped
  the `id` and `tool_name` fields (#16) and unified slug-collision handling to
  fail-fast app-wide (#17), so identity is simply a globally-unique file-stem
  slug. Single-level delegation remains the one real rule and is enforced
  structurally. A **post-implementation simplification** (#20) then replaced
  the `as_tool()`-based delegate tool — and the per-specialist `asyncio.Lock`
  + `specialist_agent.run` monkeypatch/stream-capture it needed to finalize
  MAF's internal `ResponseStream` on timeout/cancellation — with a
  hand-written, non-streaming `@tool(schema=...)` function tool that builds a
  fresh specialist `Agent` per call: a delegate never needed the specialist's
  streamed tokens, so removing the streaming removed the lock and the
  monkeypatch with it, at no behavior change to the coordinator.
  **No mechanical blockers remain; the final verdict is Go.** Both product
  choices previously open here are now decided by the reviewer (#5, #18).
- **Human sign-off: Pending.** No open questions remain. `status` is `In review`
  while this PR is under review; it moves to `Finalized` once the reviewer
  records final sign-off here.

### Resolved product questions

Both questions previously open here were decided on 2026-07-15:

- **Field name → `subagents`** (Decision #5) — chosen over `delegates_to` /
  `agents` / reusing `workflows`, to avoid colliding with FRD 0004's `workflows`
  field.
- **Who may declare `subagents` → any independently runnable agent**
  (Decision #18). Single-level delegation (#6) still holds: when such an agent is
  itself invoked as a sub-agent, its `subagents` are not wired and it cannot
  delegate onward. Simpler than a main-only rule and consistent with the
  cross-framework norm (#15).

### Deferred wording and fast-follow notes

- Finalize the exact `arg_description` wording during implementation so
  coordinators reliably produce a self-contained `task`.
- The handoff FRD, not v1, will choose between beta
  `agent-framework-orchestrations` (`1.0.0b260507`,
  `core>=1.3.0,<2`) and stable `1.0.0`, which requires `core>=1.9.0`.
