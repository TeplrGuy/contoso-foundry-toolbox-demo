# Trigger Reference

This document describes the trigger types that can be used in `.agent.md` front matter. The runtime builds on the Azure Functions Python `FunctionApp` decorator model, with a few agent-specific rules.

## How Triggers Work

Each `*.agent.md` file requires either a `trigger` section or at least one enabled `builtin_endpoints` value — **unless** it is an internal specialist agent (see [Endpoint-less internal specialists](#endpoint-less-internal-specialists) below). The `type` field selects the trigger, and `trigger.args` is passed to the underlying Azure Functions decorator.

```yaml
---
trigger:
  type: <trigger_type>
  args:
    <param>: <value>
---
```

Runtime rules:

- Do not set `arg_name` in `trigger.args`. The runtime always injects `arg_name: trigger_data` for non-HTTP Azure Functions triggers.
- `http_trigger` is the agent-runtime name for the Azure Functions `route(...)` decorator. Use `http_trigger`, not `route`.
- Connector-triggered agents use `connector_trigger`, which maps to the Azure Functions Python `connector_trigger(...)` decorator.
- Other supported trigger types map directly to `FunctionApp.<trigger_type>(arg_name="trigger_data", **trigger.args)`.
- `timer_trigger` accepts 5-part cron expressions; the runtime prepends seconds before registration.
- String values under `trigger.*`, including `type`, follow [environment variable substitution](./front-matter-spec.md#environment-variable-substitution).

### Endpoint-less internal specialists

An agent may omit **both** `trigger` and `builtin_endpoints` if — and only if — it is referenced by
another agent's `subagents:` list ([chat-time delegation](./front-matter-spec.md#subagents), FRD
0007). Such an agent registers no Azure Function trigger and no `/agents/{slug}/*` routes of its own;
it is reachable only as a `delegate_<slug>` tool on whichever coordinator(s) declare it as a
specialist. This is checked globally across the whole app — the specialist file can live anywhere
(root or `agents/`) and can appear before or after the coordinator that references it in discovery
order.

An agent with neither `trigger` nor an enabled `builtin_endpoints` value, and that is **not**
referenced by any other agent's `subagents:`, is invalid and fails validation — it would otherwise be
completely unreachable. See [`samples/multi-agent-delegation/`](../samples/multi-agent-delegation/)
for a runnable example (`tech.agent.md` is one such endpoint-less specialist).

### Starting Dynamic Workflows

When an agent sets `workflows.enabled: true`, each supported declared
trigger can initiate a Dynamic Workflow. Its handler receives the Durable client
and uses that agent's slug and immutable workflow policy. The runtime schedules the
workflow asynchronously, and the trigger Function does not wait for it to finish.

This behavior is generic across HTTP, timer, queue, blob, Event Grid, Service
Bus, connector, and the other supported trigger decorators. HTTP uses the
caller-provided or generated session ID. Non-HTTP invocations generate a fresh
session ID; there is intentionally no app-wide index for finding those sessions, so
the workflow should publish its terminal result and operators should use
Durable/DTS tooling for management.

See [Trigger-started workflows](./workflows.md#trigger-started-workflows) for
HTTP and non-HTTP completion behavior, and the
[queue workflow sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-agents-runtime/blob/main/samples/workflow-queue-p0-report/README.md) for a
runnable example.

## Unsupported Trigger Decorators

These Azure Functions Python decorators are intentionally not supported as `.agent.md` triggers.

| Do not use | Why | Use instead |
|---|---|---|
| `route` | The runtime owns HTTP handler creation and response validation. | `http_trigger` |
| `schedule` | The runtime uses only the explicit timer trigger name. | `timer_trigger` |
| `activity_trigger` | Durable Functions activity triggers do not match the agent request/response handler shape. | A regular supported trigger that calls an agent, or custom Functions code. |
| `orchestration_trigger` | Durable orchestrators require Durable-specific context handling. | Custom Durable Functions code outside `.agent.md`. |
| `entity_trigger` | Durable entities require Durable-specific context handling. | Custom Durable Functions code outside `.agent.md`. |
| `warm_up_trigger` | Warm-up triggers are host lifecycle hooks, not user/event payload triggers for agents. | Use `timer_trigger` or another event trigger for agent work. |
| `assistant_skill_trigger` | Azure Functions assistant skill triggers overlap with agent tool/MCP concepts but use a different extension contract. | Project tools, skills, or MCP servers. |
| `mcp_tool_trigger` | Runtime MCP tool endpoints are registered by `builtin_endpoints.mcp`. | `builtin_endpoints.mcp: true`. |
| `mcp_resource_trigger` | Runtime MCP resources are not authored as `.agent.md` triggers. | Built-in MCP surfaces. |
| `mcp_prompt_trigger` | Runtime MCP prompts are not authored as `.agent.md` triggers. | Built-in MCP surfaces. |
| Dotted connector trigger types such as `teams.new_channel_message_trigger` or `connectors.generic_trigger` | Dotted connector trigger resolution is not supported. | `connector_trigger` |

### Built-in endpoint authentication

The HTTP chat API registered by `builtin_endpoints` is protected via `builtin_endpoints.http_auth`. Modes: `function` (API key, default), `admin` (master key), `anonymous`, and `entra` (Entra ID / Azure AD). For `entra`, the chat routes rely on platform-level App Service Authentication (Easy Auth): the platform validates the Entra token and the runtime enforces the injected `x-ms-client-principal`. `http_auth` applies only to HTTP endpoints and does not affect the MCP endpoint (`/runtime/webhooks/mcp`), which is owned by the Functions MCP extension and always requires the MCP extension system key (`x-functions-key`). See [`front-matter-spec.md`](front-matter-spec.md#http_auth--endpoint-authentication) for the full schema and examples.

## HTTP Trigger

`http_trigger` exposes the agent as a REST API endpoint. It maps to Azure Functions `app.route(...)`, but the agent runtime owns the handler, prompt construction, session id, and response validation.

```yaml
trigger:
  type: http_trigger
  args:
    route: my-endpoint
    methods: ["POST"]
    http_auth: function
```

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `route` | Yes | - | URL path for the endpoint. |
| `methods` | No | `["POST"]` | HTTP methods to accept. |
| `http_auth` | No | `function` | Inbound auth policy, the same model as `builtin_endpoints.http_auth`. Accepts a string (`function`, `admin`, `anonymous`, `entra`) or an object with `mode` + optional `entra` allow-lists. |
| `auth_level` | No | `function` | **Deprecated** — use `http_auth` instead. Still accepted (`anonymous`, `function`, or `admin`); if both are set, `http_auth` wins and `auth_level` is ignored with a warning. |

### HTTP trigger authentication

`http_auth` reuses the same `EndpointAuthConfig` model as the built-in chat endpoints, so HTTP-triggered agents get identical enforcement:

- `function` (default) — Azure Functions host key check (a function or host key, `AuthLevel.FUNCTION`).
- `admin` — Azure Functions master key check (`AuthLevel.ADMIN` maps to the `_master` key, distinct from an extension system key).
- `anonymous` — no auth.
- `entra` — the route is registered anonymous at the key layer and identity is enforced in-app against the App Service Authentication (Easy Auth) `x-ms-client-principal` header, with optional tenant/audience/client-id allow-lists. Requests without a validated principal (or without verifiable Easy Auth enforcement) are rejected before the agent runs.

```yaml
trigger:
  type: http_trigger
  args:
    route: secured
    http_auth:
      mode: entra
      entra:
        tenant_id: <tenant-guid>
        allowed_audiences: ["api://my-app"]
```

See [`front-matter-spec.md`](front-matter-spec.md#http_auth--endpoint-authentication) for the full auth schema and semantics.

By default, the handler returns the agent response as `text/plain`. When `response_example` or `response_schema` is configured at the top level, the runtime instructs the model to return JSON, validates the result, and returns `application/json`.

HTTP requests can pass `x-ms-session-id`; otherwise the runtime creates a session id and returns it in the response header. The built-in debug chat UI surfaces this id (with a copy button) and lets you paste one into its settings dialog to resume an existing conversation. The dialog also keeps a per-browser **Recent sessions** list — scoped to each base URL and agent (`/agents/{slug}/`) — with auto-derived titles (from the first message) and optional rename, so you can pick a previous conversation to resume. That list is stored in browser local storage only — it is not synced across devices/browsers or aware of sessions created through the raw HTTP API by other clients. When you resume a session, the chat UI repaints up to the 200 most recent user/assistant messages by calling `GET agents/{slug}/history` (header `x-ms-session-id`), which reads the stored transcript and returns truncation metadata when older messages were omitted. Replay requires blob-backed session storage and degrades gracefully (an empty window) when storage is unconfigured or the runtime predates the endpoint.

An HTTP request receives the agent's immediate response, not the eventual
workflow result. The configured response schema/example continues to govern the
immediate response. Runtime workflow monitoring routes are available only when
the same workflow-enabled agent also enables the built-in chat API. For non-HTTP result
delivery, see
[Trigger-started workflows](./workflows.md#trigger-started-workflows).

Use `response_example` or `response_schema` at the top level, not under `trigger`.

## Timer Triggers

Use `timer_trigger` for scheduled agents. The Azure Functions `schedule` alias is not supported in agent files.

```yaml
trigger:
  type: timer_trigger
  args:
    schedule: "0 0 9 * * *"
```

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schedule` | Yes | - | NCRONTAB expression. 6-part with seconds, or 5-part with seconds prepended by the runtime. |
| `run_on_startup` | No | Host default | If `true`, the function runs when the host starts. |
| `use_monitor` | No | Host default | Whether the host monitors the schedule for missed executions. |
| `data_type` | No | Host default | Forwarded to the Azure Functions decorator. |

Examples:

- `"0 0 9 * * *"` - every day at 9:00 AM UTC.
- `"0 */5 * * * *"` - every 5 minutes.
- `"0 30 14 * * 1-5"` - weekdays at 2:30 PM UTC.

Ref: [Azure Functions custom bindings](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-register)

## Connector Triggers

Connector-triggered agents use `trigger.type: connector_trigger`. The runtime uses the Azure Functions Python `connector_trigger(...)` decorator.

```yaml
trigger:
  type: connector_trigger
```

Connector actions that an agent calls as tools should be exposed through connector-backed MCP servers in `mcp.json`; connector triggers are only for invoking an agent when an external connector event occurs.

## Trigger Payloads

For non-HTTP triggers, the agent's markdown body is passed separately as instructions. The per-invocation prompt contains the trigger type and serialized trigger data:

````
Triggered by: timer_trigger

Trigger data:
```json
{
  "past_due": false,
  "schedule_status": {
    "last": "2025-01-02T09:00:00+00:00",
    "next": "2025-01-03T09:00:00+00:00"
  },
  "schedule": {"adjust_for_dst": true}
}
```
````

The runtime serializes public Azure Functions binding objects with per-binding adapters rather
than using their Python `repr`. Text message bodies use `"body_encoding": "utf-8"`; binary
bodies are base64-encoded with `"body_encoding": "base64"`. Metadata values are JSON-safe, with
datetimes represented as ISO-8601 strings.

### Binding-specific payloads

**Blob (`InputStream`)** provides metadata only. The runtime does not call `read()` or put blob
content in the prompt. The runtime also does **not** add a blob-reading tool automatically — if
the agent needs the content, author one yourself (for example a function tool in your project's
`tools/`, or an MCP server) that fetches the blob using the `name`/`uri`. Because `uri` is a
plain blob URL with no SAS token, that tool must provide its own storage credentials — a
connection string, or a managed identity granted the **Storage Blob Data Reader** role on the
account/container.

> Richer content access — a built-in in-memory blob-reading tool (no extra storage call or
> credentials) and native multimodal ingestion (images/PDF/audio) — is tracked separately in
> [Azure/azure-functions-bucees-planning#1200](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-bucees-planning/issues/1200).
> The metadata-only payload here is the deliberate first step.

```json
{
  "name": "uploads/x.png",
  "uri": "https://storage.example.net/uploads/x.png",
  "length": 18432,
  "blob_properties": {"content_type": "image/png"},
  "metadata": {"source": "upload"}
}
```

**Queue (`QueueMessage`)** includes the decoded body and queue delivery metadata. If the body is
valid JSON, `body_json` is included as a parsed value.

```json
{
  "id": "queue-message-id",
  "body": "{\"order_id\": 42}",
  "body_encoding": "utf-8",
  "body_json": {"order_id": 42},
  "dequeue_count": 1,
  "pop_receipt": "receipt"
}
```

**Service Bus (`ServiceBusMessage`)** includes the decoded body plus canonical message and
application properties.

```json
{
  "body": "process order 42",
  "body_encoding": "utf-8",
  "message_id": "message-42",
  "subject": "order.created",
  "delivery_count": 1,
  "application_properties": {"tenant": "contoso"},
  "user_properties": {"priority": "high"}
}
```

**Event Grid (`EventGridEvent`)** preserves the event envelope and parsed event data.

```json
{

**Event Hubs (`EventHubEvent`)** and **Kafka (`KafkaEvent`)** include their decoded bodies and
broker metadata.

```json
{
  "body": "telemetry payload",
  "body_encoding": "utf-8",
  "partition_key": "device-7",
  "sequence_number": 123,
  "offset": "456",
  "enqueued_time": "2025-01-02T09:00:00+00:00",
  "iothub_metadata": {"device": "device-7"}
}
```

```json
{
  "body": "order payload",
  "body_encoding": "utf-8",
  "key": "order-42",
  "topic": "orders",
  "partition": 2,
  "offset": 456,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-02T09:00:00Z",
  "headers": [{"correlation-id": "abc"}]
}
```

**Timer (`TimerRequest`)** is serialized from its public properties. `TimerRequest` does not
provide `to_dict()`.

```json
{
  "past_due": false,
  "schedule_status": {
    "last": "2025-01-02T09:00:00+00:00",
    "next": "2025-01-03T09:00:00+00:00"
  },
  "schedule": {"adjust_for_dst": true}
}
```

**Cosmos DB (`DocumentList`)**, **Azure SQL (`SqlRowList`)**, and **MySQL (`MySqlRowList`)**
serialize as JSON arrays of document or row mappings, preserving null entries.

```json
[
  {"id": "document-42", "status": "new"},
  null
]
```

When Event Hubs, Kafka, or Service Bus delivers a plain batch list, each message is serialized
with the same per-message shape and the prompt contains a JSON array.

HTTP-triggered agents use the same split: markdown body as instructions, request body data in the prompt.

````
HTTP request data:
```json
{"hello": "world"}
```
````

The agent uses this context plus its instructions to decide what actions to take.
