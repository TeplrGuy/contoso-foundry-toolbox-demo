# azurefunctions-agents-runtime (Preview)

> **Public preview.** The features described here are available for preview use and may change before general availability.

A markdown-first programming model for building AI agents on Azure Functions, powered by the [Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework).

📖 **Full documentation:** [azure.github.io/azure-functions-agents-runtime](https://azure.github.io/azure-functions-agents-runtime/)

- **Build agents with markdown** — write instructions, configure triggers, and bind tools in `.agent.md` files
- **Run on any Azure Functions trigger** — trigger agents on timer, queue, blob, HTTP, Event Hub, Service Bus, Cosmos DB, and more
- **Connect to 1,400+ services** — use connector-backed MCP servers to let agents act through Office 365, Teams, SQL, Salesforce, SAP, and hundreds of other connectors
- **Extend with MCP servers** — plug in remote HTTP MCP servers, including MCP servers backed by connectors
- **Build custom tools in plain Python** — drop a `.py` file in `tools/`, decorate functions with `@tool`, and pull in any package you need
- **Run agents on durable workflows** *(experimental, see [`docs/workflows.md`](docs/workflows.md))* — one frontmatter flag turns on a DAG-of-tools execution model that fans out, waits, and survives restarts, **without** burning tokens on intermediate results
- **Automatic HTTP and MCP endpoints** — optionally expose your agent as an HTTP chat API and MCP server with no extra code
- **Evaluate authored behavior** *(preview)* — run native Vally evaluations against the same chat surface under Core Tools or in staging
- **Serverless with built-in session management** — scales to zero, persists multi-turn conversations in Azure Blob Storage
- **Pluggable model providers** — bring OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or Microsoft Foundry credentials and the runtime auto-detects the right client
- **MAF execution controls** — set output limits and optional Microsoft Agent Framework token-budget conversation compaction

### Experimental Copilot harness

MAF remains the default. A separate, local-only
[Copilot foundation sample](samples/copilot-preview/README.md) supports an explicit
`AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_ENABLE_COPILOT=true` opt-in for non-streaming HTTP,
filtered explicit Python tools, the configured `web_request` tool, session-bound
ACA `execute_python` adapter wiring, host-validated structured results on
authored HTTP-trigger routes, and completed-turn native-session continuity. ACA
catalog/session scoping is unit-qualified; real Copilot-to-ACA execution remains
a separately gated acceptance item. It documents the pinned SDK/runtime,
OpenAI key, Azure OpenAI key/Entra and Foundry Entra setup, supported tool
policy, unsupported capabilities, real request/tool/follow-up verification and
the flag-off restart path. Ambient SDK shell/file/web/todo/task/human-input
tools are disabled. This is not production activation or session
persistence/MCP/skills/role/streaming parity; existing MAF history is
untouched. Configured output-token caps are not supported in this Copilot
preview; MAF retains its output-limit controls. Custom `ClientManager`
implementations remain MAF-only and are rejected explicitly when Copilot is on.

## Installation

The package is published on PyPI as **`azurefunctions-agents-runtime`**.

```bash
pip install azurefunctions-agents-runtime
```

Add it to your function app's `requirements.txt`:

```
azurefunctions-agents-runtime
```

## Model Provider Configuration

The runtime uses Microsoft Agent Framework, which supports Microsoft Foundry, Azure OpenAI, and OpenAI as inference back-ends. The public preview quickstart and samples use **Microsoft Foundry** as the primary path, pinned with `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_PROVIDER=foundry`.

| Provider | `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_PROVIDER` | Required env vars | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Foundry | `foundry` | `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`, `FOUNDRY_MODEL` | Recommended quickstart/sample path. Uses `DefaultAzureCredential`; run `az login` locally and set `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` in multi-identity Function Apps. |
| Azure OpenAI | `azure_openai` | `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`, optional `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` | Alternative Azure-hosted provider. `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` takes precedence over `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_MODEL`. If `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` is omitted the SDK uses `DefaultAzureCredential` (AAD). |
| OpenAI | `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, optional `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_MODEL` (default `gpt-4o-mini`) | Alternative non-Azure provider. `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_MODEL` applies directly for OpenAI. |

If `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_PROVIDER` is unset, auto-detection picks the first provider whose env vars are set, in this order: `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` → `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` → `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Set `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_PROVIDER` to make the provider choice intentional.

Model resolution precedence is: explicit requested model > provider-specific env (`FOUNDRY_MODEL` for Foundry, `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` for Azure OpenAI) > `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_MODEL` > provider default.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create the agent file

Create `main.agent.md`:

```markdown
---
name: My Agent
description: A helpful assistant

builtin_endpoints: true
---

You are a helpful assistant. Answer questions concisely.
```

### 2. Create the function app entry point

Create `function_app.py`:

```python
from azure_functions_agents import create_function_app

app = create_function_app()
```

> The app root is auto-detected from `AzureWebJobsScriptRoot` (set by `func start` and the Azure Functions host). You can override it with `create_function_app(app_root=Path(__file__).parent)` or the `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_APP_ROOT` env var.

### 3. Create `agents.config.yaml`

```yaml
# Default runtime configuration
model: $FOUNDRY_MODEL
timeout: 900
```

### 4. Create `host.json`

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "extensions": {
    "http": {
      "routePrefix": ""
    }
  },
  "extensionBundle": {
    "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
    "version": "[4.*, 5.0.0)"
  }
}
```

### 5. Create `requirements.txt`

```
azurefunctions-agents-runtime
```

Connector-backed tools are exposed through MCP servers in `mcp.json`, and connector-triggered apps use the Azure Functions Connector Extension through the Functions extension bundle. No package extra is required.

### 6. Set the model provider

For local development with Microsoft Foundry, sign in with `az login`, then create `local.settings.json`:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python",
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_PROVIDER": "foundry",
    "FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT": "https://<project-name>.<region>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project-name>",
    "FOUNDRY_MODEL": "gpt-5.4"
  }
}
```

### 7. Start Azurite (local storage emulator)

The MCP server endpoint and non-HTTP triggers (timer, queue, blob, etc.) require a storage account. Locally, use [Azurite](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite) via Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name azurite -p 10000:10000 -p 10001:10001 -p 10002:10002 \
  mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite \
  azurite --skipApiVersionCheck --blobHost 0.0.0.0 --queueHost 0.0.0.0 --tableHost 0.0.0.0
```

### 8. Run locally

```bash
func start
```

Your agent is now running at `http://localhost:7071/agents/main/` with a built-in chat UI, HTTP API (`/agents/main/chat`, `/agents/main/chatstream`), and MCP tool exposed through the Functions MCP endpoint (`/runtime/webhooks/mcp`).

## Features

**Architecture overview:** see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the module map and data flow pipeline.

### Built-in endpoints

Any `.agent.md` file can opt into built-in endpoints with `builtin_endpoints`. The route slug comes from the `.agent.md` filename after sanitization, not from the display `name:` field.

- **Debug chat UI** — built-in single-page web interface at `/agents/{slug}/`
- **HTTP APIs** — `POST /agents/{slug}/chat` (JSON) and `POST /agents/{slug}/chatstream` (SSE)
- **MCP tool** — optional tool exposed through `/runtime/webhooks/mcp` for VS Code, Claude Desktop, etc.
- **Session persistence** — multi-turn conversations stored in Azure Blob Storage via the runtime's `BlobHistoryProvider`, reusing the function app's `AzureWebJobsStorage` account

If any built-in endpoint is enabled, `trigger` is optional. This allows endpoint-only agents as well as triggered agents that also expose a chat UI or API. `builtin_endpoints.debug_chat_ui: true` automatically enables the backing chat APIs. `builtin_endpoints: true` is shorthand for enabling all built-in endpoints, including the MCP tool. See [`docs/front-matter-spec.md#builtin_endpoints`](docs/front-matter-spec.md#builtin_endpoints).

### Agent evaluations (preview)

The repository's Vally 0.16.0 custom executor tests an agent through its existing synchronous chat
API. A native `eval.yaml` can target a local Core Tools host or deployed staging Function App and
use Vally's deterministic or model-based graders, repeated trials, reports, and CI verdicts. The
Python runtime remains evaluation-framework-neutral. See the [evaluation guide](docs/evaluation.md)
and [evaluation sample](samples/agent-evaluation/).

### Agent configuration

By default, agents execute through Microsoft Agent Framework's harness-agent mechanism. Optional global
defaults and recursive per-agent overrides configure model output and conversation compaction
limits. The local Copilot opt-in rejects configured output limits rather than silently
dropping them.

```yaml
# agents.config.yaml
agent_configuration:
  max_output_tokens: 4096
  agent_framework:
    compaction:
      max_context_window_tokens: 8192
```

Agents recursively inherit global `agent_configuration` values. Per-agent values override individual
leaves, while explicit `null` clears inherited values. `max_output_tokens` may stand alone;
Microsoft Agent Framework compaction requires an effective output limit smaller than
`max_context_window_tokens`. See
[`docs/front-matter-spec.md#agent_configuration`](docs/front-matter-spec.md#agent_configuration).

#### Securing endpoints

By default the chat API requires a function/host key (`http_auth: function`). Configure `builtin_endpoints.http_auth` to change the policy — `admin` (system key), `anonymous`, or `entra` (Entra ID / Azure AD). In `entra` mode the runtime relies on platform App Service Authentication (Easy Auth): the platform validates the Entra token and the runtime enforces the injected `x-ms-client-principal` (with optional tenant/audience/client-id allowlists). Because the `entra` route is anonymous, the runtime trusts that header only with non-spoofable evidence Easy Auth is enforced (`WEBSITE_AUTH_ENABLED` or the `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_ENTRA_EASY_AUTH` app setting) and fails closed (401) otherwise. `http_auth` applies only to HTTP endpoints and does not affect the MCP endpoint (`/runtime/webhooks/mcp`), which is owned by the Functions host and always requires the MCP extension system key. See [`docs/front-matter-spec.md#http_auth--endpoint-authentication`](docs/front-matter-spec.md#http_auth--endpoint-authentication).

### Event-driven agents (`<name>.agent.md`)

Define event-triggered agents with `.agent.md` files. Each file corresponds to a single Azure Function. Supported trigger types:

- **Event triggers** — timer, queue, blob, Event Hub, Service Bus, Cosmos DB, Teams, Office 365, etc.
- **HTTP triggers** — expose agents as REST API endpoints; add `response_example` or `response_schema` for validated JSON responses

Agent files can be placed at the app root or in an `agents/` folder:
```
my-app/
├── agent.md                 # Bare single-agent alias → slug "main" (is_main=true)
│                            # Alternatives: main.agent.md → slug "main", CLAUDE.md → slug "main"
│                            # (agent.md, CLAUDE.md, and main.agent.md are all aliases;
│                            #  only one may be present in the same app)
├── agents/                  # Optional folder for organization
│   ├── chat.agent.md
│   └── report.claude.md     # *.claude.md is equivalent to *.agent.md — prefix becomes slug
├── tools/
└── skills/
```

### Shared capabilities
- **Markdown-first** — agent instructions, trigger config, and tool bindings in `.agent.md` files
- **Skills** — progressive-disclosure prompt modules under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (loaded on demand via MAF's `SkillsProvider`)
- **Custom tools** — drop a `.py` file in `tools/`, decorate functions with `@tool`, and they become callable
- **Connector-backed MCP tools** — call Office 365, Teams, SQL, Salesforce, SAP, and other connectors through HTTP MCP servers
- **MCP servers** — connect to external remote HTTP MCP servers for additional tools
- **Sandbox** — Python code execution via Azure Container Apps dynamic sessions; if no explicit sandbox session id is supplied, each invocation gets a fresh GUID-backed session
- **Web request** — built-in, default-on `web_request` tool for outbound HTTP(S) calls to public hosts, guarded by an always-on SSRF security floor; no Azure resource required. Disable app-wide with `system_tools.web_request: false`, or per-agent with `system_tools.web_request: false` in that agent's front matter

### Multi-agent delegation (`subagents`)

Any independently runnable agent can declare `subagents:` to call other agents as chat-time tools —
no `HandoffBuilder`, no HITL, no new dependency ([FRD 0007](docs/frds/0007-multi-agent-delegation.md)):

```yaml
---
name: Support Coordinator
subagents:
  - agent: billing               # references agents/billing.agent.md (or billing.agent.md) by slug
    when: "Billing, invoices, refunds, or subscription questions"
  - agent: tech_support          # references agents/tech-support.agent.md — slug is the sanitized file stem
    when: "Technical troubleshooting or product bugs"
---

Route the user's request to the right specialist, or answer directly for anything general.
```

Each entry becomes a hand-written `delegate_<slug>` function tool on the
coordinator, built eagerly for each request but only *run* (building the specialist's own agent)
if the coordinator's model selects it. A few
rules to know before you reach for this:

- **Trust boundary**: `subagents` is an authoring-time capability grant. One app is one trust
  domain — a specialist's own `builtin_endpoints`/auth level is never consulted when it is invoked as
  a sub-agent; if a coordinator lists it, its full capability set is reachable through that
  coordinator (Decision #10).
- **Write a self-contained `task`**: the specialist does not see the coordinator's conversation
  history, session, or any other request context (`propagate_session=False`) — it only receives the
  `task` string the coordinator's model passes to the tool. Instruct the coordinator (via
  `when:` / its own instructions) to pass every fact the specialist needs, not just a short pointer.
- **Single-level only**: delegation does not chain. A specialist invoked via `delegate_<slug>` runs
  with its own instructions/model/tools, but its *own* `subagents:` (if it declares any) are not wired
  up for that call — only a top-level coordinator gets `delegate_*` tools (Decision #6).
- **Slugs must be globally unique**: a `subagents` reference resolves by file-stem slug, the same
  identity used for `builtin_endpoints` routes — see the breaking-change note under
  [Multiple functions from markdown](#multiple-functions-from-markdown) below.
- An agent referenced only as a specialist may skip `trigger` and `builtin_endpoints` entirely — see
  [`docs/triggers.md#endpoint-less-internal-specialists`](docs/triggers.md#endpoint-less-internal-specialists).

See [`docs/front-matter-spec.md#subagents`](docs/front-matter-spec.md#subagents) for the full field
reference, [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md#5-multi-agent-delegation-subagents) for how
this fits into the composition pipeline, and
[`samples/multi-agent-delegation/`](samples/multi-agent-delegation/) for a runnable coordinator +
two-specialist example.

## Agent File Format (`.agent.md`)

Agent files use YAML frontmatter + markdown body:

```yaml
---
name: Agent Name
description: What this agent does

# Optional: system tools (code execution)
system_tools:
  dynamic_sessions_code_interpreter:
    endpoint: $ACA_SESSION_POOL_ENDPOINT

# Optional when builtin_endpoints is enabled; required otherwise:
trigger:
  type: timer_trigger      # or queue_trigger, connector_trigger, etc.
  args:
    schedule: "0 0 9 * * *"  # trigger-specific params passed as kwargs

logger: true               # optional, default true
substitute_variables: true # optional, default true — env-var replacement in frontmatter + body

# For HTTP-triggered agents: expected response format
response_example: |        # optional — agent returns structured JSON matching this example
  {
    "summary": "A brief summary",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
  }
---

Agent instructions in markdown...
```

> **Note**: Earlier preview releases supported a `runtime: copilot|maf` frontmatter field. As of 1.0.0 only Microsoft Agent Framework is used and the field is ignored (with a one-time warning per agent file). Remove it from your `.agent.md` files.

### Multiple functions from markdown

- **`*.agent.md` with `trigger`** — creates an event-triggered Azure Function. Exactly one trigger per file.
- **`*.agent.md` with `builtin_endpoints`** — also serves `/agents/{slug}/`, `/agents/{slug}/chat`, and `/agents/{slug}/chatstream` when chat endpoints are enabled, and can expose an MCP tool when `builtin_endpoints: true` or `builtin_endpoints.mcp: true`. The sanitized filename stem becomes the base Azure Function name, endpoint slug, and the agent's global identity (its slug — also used for `delegate_<slug>` tool names, see [Multi-agent delegation](#multi-agent-delegation-subagents) above). The frontmatter `name:` field is display-only. See [`docs/front-matter-spec.md#function-name-resolution`](docs/front-matter-spec.md#function-name-resolution) and [`docs/front-matter-spec.md#builtin_endpoints`](docs/front-matter-spec.md#builtin_endpoints).

> **Flexible filename conventions:** Beyond `*.agent.md`, the runtime also supports:
> - **`agent.md`** (any casing: `Agent.md`, `AGENT.MD`) and **`CLAUDE.md`** (any casing: `Claude.md`, `claude.md`) — bare aliases for `main.agent.md` that produce slug `main` and `is_main=True`. `agent.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `main.agent.md` all produce the same slug so at most one may be present in the same app.
> - **`*.claude.md`** — e.g. `summarizer.claude.md` is equivalent to `summarizer.agent.md`; the prefix becomes the slug.
> - **Case-insensitive suffix matching** — `.agent.md` and `.claude.md` suffixes are matched case-insensitively (`Report.AGENT.md` is valid but collides with `report.agent.md`).

> **⚠️ Breaking change**: Earlier releases silently auto-suffixed (`_2`, `_3`, ...) when two agent files
> sanitized to the same name. **Slugs are now required to be globally unique across the whole app.** A
> collision (for example `daily-report.agent.md` and `daily_report.agent.md`, which both sanitize to
> `daily_report`) now **fails fast at startup** with an actionable error telling you which files
> collided, instead of silently registering a `_2`-suffixed duplicate. Rename one of the colliding
> files to fix it. This also applies to `.agent.md` files that only participate as
> [delegation specialists](#multi-agent-delegation-subagents) and never register their own trigger or
> endpoints — every agent's slug is checked against the same app-wide index.

When a triggered function runs, the agent's markdown body is used as the system instructions. The prompt sent to the agent includes the trigger type and JSON-safe binding data:

```
Triggered by: service_bus_queue_trigger

Trigger data:
```json
{"body": "...", "message_id": "...", ...}
```​
```

For non-HTTP Azure Functions bindings, the runtime serializes public binding fields instead of the
binding object's Python representation: Queue, Service Bus, Event Hubs, and Kafka bodies include
an encoding marker; Event Grid includes its parsed `data`; timers include `past_due`,
`schedule_status`, and `schedule`; and Cosmos DB/SQL batches become JSON arrays. Blob triggers
include blob name, URI, properties, and metadata only; they do not read blob content, so provide a
tool when an agent must fetch it. HTTP request-body handling remains separate.

For concrete payload examples and a complete reference of supported triggers and parameters, see
[docs/triggers.md](docs/triggers.md).

### Trigger type resolution

| Format | Resolves to | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `http_trigger` | Runtime HTTP adapter over `app.route(...)` | `http_trigger` |
| No dots | `app.<type>(...)` | `timer_trigger`, `queue_trigger` |
| `connector_trigger` | `app.connector_trigger(...)` | `connector_trigger` |

### HTTP-triggered agents

HTTP-triggered agents expose REST API endpoints that accept JSON input and return structured JSON output. Use `response_example` in the frontmatter to define the expected response format:

```yaml
---
name: Summarize
trigger:
  type: http_trigger
  args:
    route: summarize
    methods: ["POST"]
    auth_level: FUNCTION     # ANONYMOUS | FUNCTION | ADMIN (default: FUNCTION)
response_example: |
  {
    "summary": "A brief summary of the content",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
    "sentiment": "positive"
  }
---

Analyze the provided content and return a structured summary.
```

The agent receives the HTTP request body as input and is instructed to return JSON matching the example. If `response_example` is omitted, the raw agent text is returned as `text/plain`.

`response_schema` (JSON Schema) is also supported as an alternative to `response_example` for advanced use cases.

### Environment variable substitution

`docs/front-matter-spec.md#environment-variable-substitution` is the authoritative reference. In short, the runtime resolves `$VAR` and `%VAR%` placeholders inline in every string value in `agents.config.yaml`, `mcp.json`, agent frontmatter values, and the markdown body (outside fenced code blocks). Missing variables are left as literal placeholders.

#### Agent instructions (markdown body)

Variable references are resolved inline at load time anywhere string values are supported. Both `$VAR_NAME` and `%VAR_NAME%` syntaxes are supported, where the identifier must match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`:

```markdown
---
name: Notifier
description: Sends updates to $TEAM_NAME
system_tools:
  dynamic_sessions_code_interpreter:
    endpoint: "https://$HOST/api"
---

Send a daily summary email to $TO_EMAIL.
Post a message to the %TEAM_NAME% team's General channel.
```

If `HOST=contoso.internal`, `TO_EMAIL=alice@example.com`, and `TEAM_NAME=Engineering` are set in the environment, those values resolve inline:

> `endpoint: "https://contoso.internal/api"`
>
> Send a daily summary email to alice@example.com.
>
> Post a message to the Engineering team's General channel.

If a referenced variable is not set, the original `$VAR_NAME` or `%VAR_NAME%` text is left unchanged.

The runtime does **not** substitute dictionary keys, `${FOO}` brace syntax, identifiers starting with a digit such as `$9PORT`, or text inside fenced code blocks (`` ``` ``), so documentation examples in your instructions are preserved.

For the `$IDENT` syntax, identifiers that include characters outside `[A-Za-z0-9_]` (for example `$VAR-NAME`) are matched greedily up to the first invalid character — so `$VAR-NAME` resolves to `<value-of-VAR>-NAME` when `VAR` is set, and stays `$VAR-NAME` when `VAR` is unset. The `%IDENT%` syntax requires a closing `%` immediately after the identifier, so tokens like `%VAR-NAME%` remain fully literal. Quote or escape the surrounding text if you need a `$IDENT` token to remain literal.

To disable substitution for an agent's frontmatter values and markdown body, set `substitute_variables: false` in the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: My Agent
substitute_variables: false
---

Instructions with literal $VAR references that should not be replaced.
```

> **Note**: `substitute_variables` itself is read before env-var substitution. It must be a literal boolean (`true` or `false`). Setting `substitute_variables: $MY_FLAG` will not be resolved and defaults to `true`.

## Custom Python tools

Drop a `.py` file in `tools/` and decorate functions with `@tool`. The runtime auto-discovers them at import time and adds them to every agent.

```python
# tools/my_tools.py
from azure_functions_agents import tool

@tool
def reverse_string(text: str) -> str:
    """Reverse the input string."""
    return text[::-1]
```

`@tool` is re-exported from `agent_framework`. Functions can be sync or async; types in the signature feed MAF's automatic JSON-Schema generation. Tools that need richer schemas can be declared with `agent_framework.FunctionTool` directly.

Dynamic Workflow tools live in the same `tools/` directory but must opt in
explicitly with `@workflow_tool` so they can run safely as Durable
Function activities:

```python
from typing import Any

from azure_functions_agents import workflow_tool


@workflow_tool(description="Fetch recent log lines for a service.")
def fetch_logs(args: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    return {"service": args["service"], "lines": ["..."]}
```

Use both `@tool` and `@workflow_tool` when the same callable should be
available both directly in chat and inside workflows. A workflow tool can own
the retry policy for an operation that is safe to repeat and the maximum wait
for each attempt:

```python
from azure_functions_agents import WorkflowRetryBackoff, WorkflowRetryPolicy


@workflow_tool(
    retry=WorkflowRetryPolicy(
        max_attempts=3,
        backoff=WorkflowRetryBackoff(initial="PT1S", multiplier=2.0, max="PT4S"),
    ),
    timeout="PT30S",
)
def reserve_inventory(args: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    ...
```

Decorator precedence applies separately to plan-authored `execution.retry` and
`execution.timeout`. The tool raises `WorkflowRetryableError` when a failure is
safe to retry. An expired attempt uses `workflow_task_timeout`. A plan can set
`execution.continue_on_error: true` to give a bounded permitted failure result
to dependent tasks after the attempt budget is complete. See
[`docs/workflows.md`](docs/workflows.md) for the Activity handler
contract, `workflows.exclude`, retry, timeout, continuation, and host limits.
Any agent can enable workflows; triggers and built-in endpoints independently
determine how that agent is invoked. See the
[`per-agent-workflows`](samples/per-agent-workflows) sample for two independent
non-main workflow-enabled agents sharing one Durable engine.

## Built-in Endpoint Routes

Built-in endpoints are explicit per agent. The filename stem determines `{slug}`; for example, `main.agent.md` uses `main` and `daily_azure_report.agent.md` uses `daily_azure_report`.

### Chat UI

A built-in single-page chat interface served at `/agents/{slug}/` when `builtin_endpoints.debug_chat_ui: true` (or `builtin_endpoints: true`). No frontend code needed — just open `http://localhost:7071/agents/main/` locally for `main.agent.md`, or `https://<your-app>.azurewebsites.net/agents/{slug}/` when deployed. See [`docs/front-matter-spec.md#function-name-resolution`](docs/front-matter-spec.md#function-name-resolution).

On first load, you'll be prompted for the base URL and a function key (for deployed apps). These are stored in browser local storage and can be changed via the gear icon.

The chat UI manages the session id for you. The active id is shown beneath the status line with a **Copy** button, and you can resume an existing conversation by pasting its id into the **Session ID (optional)** field in the settings dialog. Pasted ids are validated client-side against the same rule the server enforces (`^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,128}$`) and persist in browser local storage per base URL and agent (each `/agents/{slug}/`), so a resumed conversation survives page reloads and new tabs. Use **New session** to clear the id and start fresh.

The settings dialog also keeps a **Recent sessions** list (most-recent first, up to 8 per base URL and agent). Each turn adds or updates an entry, auto-titling it with your first message (renameable via **Rename**); pick one to fill the Session ID field and **Save** to resume it, or use **Remove** / **Clear recent** to prune the list. This list is a per-browser convenience stored in local storage — it is **not** synced across devices or browsers, and it does not include sessions created through the raw HTTP API from other clients.

When you resume a session — whether by pasting an id or picking one from **Recent sessions** — the chat window reloads that conversation's earlier messages from the server (via a `GET /agents/{slug}/history` endpoint) so its history is visible right away, not just carried invisibly into your next turn. The replay is capped at the 200 most recent user and assistant messages; the UI shows a notice when older messages were omitted. Intermediate tool activity is not replayed. This requires the app's blob-backed [session storage](#session-storage) to be configured; without it — or on an older runtime that predates the history endpoint — the window simply starts empty and the resumed session still continues on your next message.

### HTTP Chat API

POST endpoints for programmatic access:

- **Any agent with `builtin_endpoints.chat_api: true`:** `POST /agents/{slug}/chat` and `POST /agents/{slug}/chatstream`

The JSON endpoint returns `session_id`, `response`, and `tool_calls`. The streaming endpoint uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) with `session`, `delta`, `intermediate`, `tool_start`, `tool_end`, `done`, and `error` events.

Pass `x-ms-session-id` header to continue a conversation across requests. If omitted, a new session is created automatically.

### MCP Server

When `builtin_endpoints: true` or `builtin_endpoints.mcp: true`, the agent is exposed as an MCP tool named after its slug through the shared MCP-compatible endpoint at `/runtime/webhooks/mcp`. Requires the MCP extension system key in the `x-functions-key` header when deployed.

### Without built-in endpoints

If no agent enables built-in endpoints, no chat UI, chat API, chatstream, or agent MCP tool is registered. The app still runs triggered functions. See [`docs/front-matter-spec.md#builtin_endpoints`](docs/front-matter-spec.md#builtin_endpoints).

## MCP Server Configuration

You can give your agent access to external MCP servers by creating an `mcp.json` file in the app root. Only remote HTTP MCP servers are supported. The `type` field is optional — when omitted, an entry with a `url` is treated as HTTP. When `type` is specified it must be `"http"` or `"streamable-http"`; any other transport (e.g. `stdio`, `sse`) is rejected with a warning.

String values in `mcp.json` support inline environment-variable substitution with both `$VAR` and `%VAR%`. Eligible fields include `url`, `headers` values, `type`, `tools` entries, and Azure identity auth values such as `auth.scope` and `auth.client_id`. Dictionary keys such as server names, environment-variable names, and header names are not substituted.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "microsoft-learn": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://$MCP_HOST/api",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer $LEARN_MCP_TOKEN"
      }
    },
    "custom-api": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer $MCP_TOKEN"
      }
    },
    "office365-outlook": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "$O365_MCP_SERVER_URL",
      "tools": ["office365_SendEmailV2"],
      "auth": {
        "scope": "https://apihub.azure.com/.default",
        "client_id": "$O365_MCP_CLIENT_ID"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Tools from configured MCP servers are automatically available to the agent at runtime. Each server entry supports:

- **`type`** — optional. When set, must be `"http"` or `"streamable-http"`. When omitted, an entry with a `url` is treated as HTTP.
- **`url`** — the MCP server endpoint URL (required)
- **`headers`** — optional HTTP headers (e.g. for authentication)
- **`tools`** — optional array of tool name patterns to allow (default: `["*"]`)
- **`auth`** — optional Azure Identity authentication configuration. Set `auth.scope` to the token scope required by the MCP server. The runtime uses `DefaultAzureCredential` to acquire the token.

The runtime loads MCP tools and skips MCP prompts. This avoids startup/runtime failures from connector-backed MCP servers that support tools but reject `prompts/list`.

By default, MCP auth follows the app-wide identity selection: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` when set, otherwise the system-assigned identity/default Azure credential chain. To choose a user-assigned managed identity for a single MCP server without changing the app-wide identity, set `auth.client_id` in that server's `mcp.json` entry. If the configured client ID is empty or an unresolved placeholder, the runtime falls back to the app-wide identity selection.

> **Note**: Entries without a `url`, with unresolved placeholders in `url`, or with a `type` other than `"http"` / `"streamable-http"`, are ignored with a warning. Use the remote HTTP transport instead.

## Session storage

Multi-turn conversations are persisted as JSON Lines, one record per message:

- **Deployed apps (recommended).** When `AzureWebJobsStorage` is configured —
  as either a connection string or the identity-based
  `AzureWebJobsStorage__blobServiceUri` setting that `azd` provisions —
  history is written to **Azure Blob Storage** via the runtime's
  `BlobHistoryProvider`. One Append Blob per agent/session pair is stored under
  `agent-sessions/{agent_slug}/{session_id}.jsonl` inside the
  `azure-functions-agents` container (override with
  `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_SESSION_CONTAINER`). No file share, no storage
  account key, no mount path; the same identity that the function app
  already uses for `AzureWebJobsStorage` reads and writes sessions. In
  multi-identity Function Apps, set `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` so
  `DefaultAzureCredential` selects the intended managed identity.
- **Local dev fallback.** When neither `AzureWebJobsStorage` nor
  `AzureWebJobsStorage__blobServiceUri` is set, history falls back to MAF's
  `FileHistoryProvider` writing to
  `{AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_SESSION_DIR}/agent-sessions/{agent_slug}/{session_id}.jsonl`,
  defaulting to `~/.azure-functions-agents/agent-sessions/`.

Session ids must match `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,128}$` — anything else is rejected at the API boundary.
The same caller-visible session id may be reused across agents for correlation, but each agent's
transcript remains independent.

> **Breaking change:** Earlier releases stored unscoped history at
> `agent-sessions/{session_id}.jsonl`; those files are not loaded automatically after upgrading.
> If continuity is required, copy each file to its corresponding agent-specific path before
> upgrading.
> Azure Blob copies must preserve the Append Blob type so later appends continue to work.

> **Single-process scope**: A per-agent/session `asyncio.Lock` serializes concurrent turns within a single Function instance. The contract is "one active turn per agent/session pair". Multi-instance distributed locking is intentionally out of scope.

## Deployment Notes

### Required Azure App Settings

Set the model provider env vars described above. The preview samples use Microsoft Foundry (`AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_PROVIDER=foundry`, `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`, and `FOUNDRY_MODEL`). Azure OpenAI (`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` + `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`) and OpenAI (`OPENAI_API_KEY` and optionally `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_MODEL`) are supported alternatives. For Microsoft Foundry and Azure OpenAI, the provider-specific model/deployment setting takes precedence over `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_AGENTS_MODEL`.

When the agent uses connector-backed MCP servers, connector triggers, or `dynamic_sessions_code_interpreter`, the function app's **system-assigned or user-assigned Managed Identity** must be enabled and granted access to the target resource — otherwise `DefaultAzureCredential` will fail to obtain a token. In multi-identity Function Apps, set `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` so the runtime uses the intended managed identity for Azure OpenAI, Foundry, blob-backed session storage, ACA Dynamic Sessions, and ARM/data-plane connector calls. For an individual MCP server, set `auth.client_id` in `mcp.json` to choose a different managed identity just for that server. For an individual code interpreter pool, set `system_tools.dynamic_sessions_code_interpreter.client_id`.

### Observability

Install `azurefunctions-agents-runtime[monitor]` to export the runtime's OpenTelemetry spans and
metrics to Application Insights. Enablement is simply the `[monitor]` extra plus
`APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`; sensitive content stays off by default and is included only
when `ENABLE_SENSITIVE_DATA=true`. The runtime emits an `agent.run` span for each invocation, a
`dynamic_session.execute` span for sandbox calls, and a `web_request` span for outbound HTTP calls
(host only — never the full URL with query string or secrets), adds `af.*` attributes, marks failures
with `af.fault_domain`, and quiets noisy third-party loggers. For full setup and the span/attribute
reference, see [`docs/observability.md`](docs/observability.md). If you also want host↔worker
correlation, `host.json` `telemetryMode: OpenTelemetry` is optional and additive.
