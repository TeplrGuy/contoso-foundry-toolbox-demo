"""Workflow-safe evidence tools for the incident-triage sample.

These are the tools the LLM gets to compose into a workflow when the
agent decides an incident warrants more than a single chat turn of
work. They are intentionally **not** used outside workflow plans:
``@workflow_tool`` opts them into Dynamic Workflow Activity execution,
and no plain public normal tool is exported from this module.

Design notes:

- Each handler takes a single ``args`` dict and returns a
  JSON-serializable dict. ``fetch_deploys`` is an ``async def`` handler
  that awaits a simulated deploy-history API call; the other handlers
  are synchronous. The workflow Activity awaits async handlers and runs
  synchronous handlers in a worker thread.
- Outputs are deterministic functions of their inputs so workflow
  replays produce stable results and so the demo narrative is
  reproducible. (Durable journals activity output, so this isn't a
  correctness requirement — it is a stakeholder-demo requirement.)
- Result shapes are deliberately *shallow* and *documented*: the
  summarize tool consumes whole upstream results via ``${id.result}``
  (not ``${id.result.path.to.deep.field}``) so the LLM doesn't have to
  guess nested keys when authoring its plan.

Result shapes (stable contract):

- ``fetch_logs`` →   ``{"service": str, "window_minutes": int,
                       "lines": [str], "errors": int, "warnings": int}``
- ``fetch_metrics`` →``{"service": str, "window_minutes": int,
                       "cpu_p99": float, "memory_p99": float,
                       "latency_p99_ms": float, "saturation": str}``
- ``fetch_deploys`` →``{"service": str, "lookback_hours": int,
                       "deploys": [{"id": str, "actor": str,
                                    "summary": str, "minutes_ago": int}]}``
- ``summarize_findings`` → ``{"service": str, "likely_cause": str,
                              "confidence": "low"|"medium"|"high",
                              "evidence": [str],
                              "recommended_action": str}``

Collection (data-driven) tools — Issue #1276:

- ``discover_services`` → ``{"incident": str, "count": int,
                            "services": [{"name": str, "tier": str,
                                          "in_scope": bool}]}``
- ``inspect_service`` →   ``{"service": str, "index": int, "errors": int,
                            "saturation": str, "healthy": bool,
                            "headline": str}``
- ``summarize_scan`` →    ``{"incident": str, "scanned": int, "skipped": int,
                            "unhealthy": [str], "headline": str}``
